<p class="center largefont">The Most Complete List Published</p>

<p>The following list does not contain all the books that Horatio Alger
wrote, but it contains most of them, and certainly the best.</p>

<p>Horatio Alger is to boys what Charles Dickens is to grown-ups. His
work is just as popular to-day as it was years ago. The books have
a quality, the value of which is beyond computation.</p>

<p>There are legions of boys of foreign parents who are being helped
along the road to true Americanism by reading these books which are
so peculiarly American in tone that the reader cannot fail to absorb
some of the spirit of fair play and clean living which is so characteristically
American.</p>

<p>In this list will be included certain books by Edward Stratemeyer,
Oliver Optic, and other authors who wrote the Alger type of stories,
which are equal in interest and wholesomeness with those written by
the famous author after which this great line of books for boys is
named.</p></div>

<p>“You don’t want that boat, Wolf, any more than
the lake wants water,” said my father, after I had
read an advertisement, in the Ruoara <em>Clarion</em>, of the
effects of a bankrupt which were to be sold at auction
the next day.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the lake would amount to much
without water; in fact, to no more than I do without
business,” I replied. “I want something to do, and if
I can buy this boat at a low price, I am sure I can
make something out of her.”</p>

<p>“What can you do with her? She is a very pretty
plaything; but you and I can’t afford such luxuries,”
added my father.</p>

<p>“I don’t want her for a plaything, father,” I persisted.
“I want to make some money out of her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>“You are an enterprising boy, Wolf; but I really
don’t see any money in a boat like that.”</p>

<p>“I think there is, though of course I may be mistaken.
Since Major Toppleton has been running his
steamers across the lake to Centreport so many times
a day, the ferry would not pay, and the owner has
gone up to Ruoara with his boat. Now, there are
many people who wish to cross between the steamers’
trips.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that would pay,” said my father,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>“There is hardly a boat to let, either in Middleport
or Centreport. I think a boat kept for parties of
pleasure would pay well. There are plenty of people
who want to go up the lake fishing; and there would
be a great many more if a decent boat were to be
had.”</p>

<p>“Well, Wolf, you have made your own money, and
you are smart enough to take care of it yourself. If
you want to go into a speculation on your own account,
I haven’t a word to say. But what will this
boat cost?”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t mean to pay anything like her<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
value. If she can be bought at a low figure, I can do
something with her, even if I have to sell her.”</p>

<p>“They say she cost five or six hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“I should say she could not be built and fitted up
for anything less than six hundred. I am willing to
go one hundred on her. If I can buy her for that, I
can turn her again so as to double my money,” I continued
confidently.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. A boat is either the best or the
worst property in the world.”</p>

<p>“I know that. It is October now, and the boating-season
is about over, though there is considerable fishing
done up the lake. Not many people want to buy
a boat in the fall, and for that reason she won’t bring
much.”</p>

<p>“Here is the hundred dollars. If you can buy her
for that, I think you will be safe enough,” added my
father, as he took the bills from the bureau drawer.</p>

<p>I was very fond of boating, and would rather have
made my living in that way than any other; but while
I could get two, or even one dollar a day for running
an engine, I could not afford to risk my chances with a
boat. I was out of business now. I had been contemptuously<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
discharged from the Lake Shore Railroad,
and, not a little to my chagrin, Colonel Wimpleton,
who had made me liberal offers to serve in his new
steamer, did not repeat them. My father also was out
of employ, and, though we were not likely to suffer at
present for the want of work, we could ill afford to
be idle.</p>

<p>I had taken it into my head that I could make something
with a good sailboat. The people of the two
towns, as well as many strangers who came to them,
were fond of fishing, and six or seven dollars a day for
such a boat as I proposed to buy would not be an
extravagant price, including, as it would, my own
services as skipper. Twenty days’ work would refund
my capital, and I could reasonably hope to obtain this
amount of business during the next two months. The
next summer she would be a small fortune to me, for
boats were in constant demand.</p>

<p>The next day I crossed the lake, and went up to
Ruoara in Colonel Wimpleton’s new steamer, the
<em>Ucayga</em>. This was the first time I had sailed in her,
and I could not help seeing that she was “a big thing.”
It seemed almost incredible to me that I had been<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
offered the situation of captain of this boat, and even
more incredible that I had refused it; but both of
these statements were true. I had come to the conclusion
that the colonel had repented of his splendid
offer.</p>

<p>Just now the Lake Shore Railroad was in the
ascendant, and the <em>Ucayga</em> was under a shadow. She
had very few passengers, while the train which had
just left Middleport had been crowded. It was a busy
season among travelers, and I heard that the colonel
was terribly galled by the ill-success of his line. Major
Toppleton had ordered the captains of the two boats
which ran up the lake to be regularly ten minutes behind
time, so that the steamer was unable to leave
Centreport in season to connect with the trains at
Ucayga. This delay entirely defeated the colonel’s
plans, and the <em>Ucayga</em> was generally obliged to leave
without any of the through passengers, which comprised
more than half. Without them the boat would
not pay.</p>

<p>It did not make much difference to Colonel Wimpleton
whether the steamer made or lost money for him,
if he could only get ahead of the railroad. The<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
<em>Ucayga</em> had failed to connect with the railroads at
the foot of the lake two or three times a week; and
this had given her a very bad reputation. It was true
that the Lightning Express, on which I had formerly
run as engineer, had been similarly unfortunate quite
a number of times; but as the major’s plan was fully
understood by the people up the lake, the train was
regarded as the surer of the two modes of conveyance.</p>

<p>Lewis Holgate, the son of the man who had robbed
my father, was still the engineer of the Lightning Express.
He was under the powerful protection of
Tommy Toppleton, who ruled all Middleport by ruling
his father, the magnate of the town. Lewis was a
treacherous wretch. He had labored to ruin me, under
the direction of his young master; but I tried to think
as kindly of him as I could. I was daily in fear that,
through his unskilful management of the locomotive,
an accident would occur on the road. I am almost
sure that Colonel Wimpleton would have hailed such
a catastrophe with satisfaction, so deep and bitter was
his hatred of Major Toppleton, and so great was his
opposition to the road. As the matter stood, neither<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
the train nor the steamer was entirely reliable. A
little more shrewdness, skill, and enterprise would
have turned the scale in favor of either.</p>

<p>The <em>Ucayga</em> started this morning without waiting
for the arrival of the up-lake steamer. As soon as she
left the wharf, I began to walk about her decks and
cabins on an exploring-tour. I was delighted with her
appointments; and, while I tried to be impartial between
the steamer and the railroad, my admiration of
the beautiful craft inclined me to believe that she
ought to win. In the course of my wanderings about
the boat, I came to the forward deck. About the first
person I encountered here was Mr. Waddie Wimpleton.
He sat on the capstan, smoking a cigar, for the
young scion of the Wimpleton house was bent on
being as “big” as anybody else.</p>

<p>“What are you doing on our boat, Wolf Penniman?”
demanded he, leaping down from his high seat
the moment he saw me.</p>

<p>“I’m going down to Ruoara on her; that’s all I’m
doing just now,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Did you come to count the passengers?” said he
bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>“I did not, though, for that matter, it would not be
a difficult task to count them.”</p>

<p>“None of your impudence, Wolf Penniman!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Waddie?” I asked, laughing.
“I suppose you know I’m not the engineer of the railroad
now, and you need not waste any hard words
upon me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see you on this boat, or on our
side of the lake,” he added, restoring the cigar to his
mouth, and looking as magnificent as a little magnate
could look.</p>

<p>“I won’t hurt you, or the boat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you won’t!”</p>

<p>“This is a splendid boat,” I continued, in a conciliatory
tone.</p>

<p>“Splendid enough.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think you are smart to let the major
get ahead of you, as he does.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“If I were running this boat, I should have my
share of the through passengers,” I replied, with all
the good-nature I possessed.</p>

<p>“You would do big things!” sneered he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>“I should try to.”</p>

<p>“You can’t come it over me, as you did over my
father.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least desire to come it over you. I
expect to go into business on my own account pretty
soon,” I replied.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for me, you would have been
captain of this boat,” said he, intending to throw his
heaviest shot by this remark.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you did what you thought was
best for the line; and if you are satisfied, I ought
to be.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t make much when you ran away from
Centreport.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I lose much. If we are both satisfied
about that, we need not quarrel.”</p>

<p>“I shall always quarrel with you, Wolf Penniman,
as long as I live,” he added spitefully. “I hate you!”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you will have a good time. For my
part, I don’t hate you, Waddie; and if I had a chance
to do you a good turn, I would do it now as quick as
ever I would.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t snuffle to me. I don’t ask any favors<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
of you. I am president of the steamboat company,
and I suppose you would like to have me get down on
my knees and beg you to take command of this boat.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” I replied, laughing.</p>

<p>“You think you are a great man!”</p>

<p>“No, I’m only a boy, like yourself.”</p>

<p>“If I had seen you before the boat started, you
should not have gone in her.”</p>

<p>“That game was tried on the other side of the lake.
It don’t work well.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you come on board of this boat again; if
you do, we will try it on.”</p>

<p>Both of the little magnates down upon me, and I
was forbidden to ride in either steamer or cars! Waddie
puffed up his cigar and walked away, evidently
with the feeling that he was not making much out of
me. The <em>Ucayga</em> touched at the wharf, and I went
on shore. So did the little magnate of Centreport.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE AUCTION AT RUOARA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was not yet time for the auction, and I waited
on the wharf to see the steamer start. She was still
a novelty in Ruoara, and many people came down to
the shore to observe her beautiful proportions, and
the speed with which she cut through the waters.
Hundreds of them made the trip to Ucayga and back
for the sole purpose of seeing the boat. After the old
steamers were taken off, and before the <em>Ucayga</em> was
put on the route, the inhabitants of this town had been
obliged to cross the ferry to Grass Springs, and take
the trains of the Lake Shore Railroad when they
wished to go in either direction. The advent of this
palatial steamer was therefore a new era to them, and
they regarded her with pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>Ruoara was situated nearly opposite Grass Springs;
but the four islands lay off the former town, and a
little below. The South Shoe was due west from the
wharf where the boat touched, and she was obliged to
back, and go over a mile out of her course, to avoid<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
the island and the shoal water which lay near it. The
South Shoe, therefore, was a nuisance in its relation to
the steamboat navigation of Ruoara. The five minutes
which this circuit required had doubtless caused
the <em>Ucayga</em> to miss her connection more than once.</p>

<p>I have been told that I am a machinist by nature.
I do not know how this may be, but I am sure that I
never see a difficulty without attempting to study out
the means to remedy it. As I stood on the wharf,
watching the winding course of the splendid steamer,
I could not help grappling with the problem of saving
this loss of time on the trip. These five minutes
might sometimes enable the boat to win the day in the
competition with the railroad.</p>

<p>As I have hinted before, I knew every foot of bottom
in this part of the lake. I had sailed hundreds
of miles among these islands, and, while I was thinking
over the matter, the key to the problem flashed
upon my mind. I do not mean to say that it was a
very brilliant idea; but, simple as it was, it had evidently
not occurred to the captain of the steamer, who
was a Hitaca man, and knew only the ordinary channels
of the lake, used by the steamers. I had an idea;<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
but I deemed it wise to keep my own counsel in the
matter, for a suggestion from me would probably have
been deemed impertinent.</p>

<p>When the <em>Ucayga</em> disappeared behind the South
Shoe, I turned my attention to the business which had
brought me to Ruoara. A short distance down the
lake, and on its bank, was a beautiful and very elaborate
cottage, which had evidently been intended as a
copy of that occupied by Colonel Wimpleton. Off the
lake-wall lay the boat which I hoped to purchase. The
owner had made an immense “spread,” and failed out
clean in the height of his glory. People who could
afford to purchase such rich and gaudy trappings as
those with which the bankrupt owner fitted up his
mansion, did not care to buy them at second-hand.
Everybody expected that the ornamental appendages
of the establishment would be sold for a tithe of their
cost; and so they were.</p>

<p>To most of the people on the lake, any boat beyond
a skiff for actual service was regarded as a luxury,
especially such a craft as that which floated off the
wall. Taking hold of the painter, I hauled her in, and
stepped on board. She was a very rakish-looking boat,<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
sloop-rigged, with a cabin forward containing two
berths, and the smallest stove it is possible to imagine.
She was about twenty-four feet long, and as well appointed
in every respect as though she had been fitted
up to cross the ocean. The owner had certainly lavished
money upon her, which he could afford to do, at
the expense of his creditors.</p>

<p>While I was examining her I saw the crowd of
purchasers moving about the house as the sale proceeded.
It was a hopeful sign that no one seemed to
care a straw about the boat. Men and women were
examining everything else about the establishment, but
the <em>Belle</em>&mdash;for that was the name I found upon her
stern&mdash;was wholly neglected. I continued my examination
without the notice of any one for some time.
I took the trap off the well, and got at the bottom. I
found that she was built in the most thorough manner.
I was sure she had cost all of six hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“What are you doing in that boat, Wolf Penniman?”</p>

<p>I raised my head from the diligent search I was
making in the bottom of the boat, and discovered Mr.
Waddie on the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>“I am looking at her,” I replied.</p>

<p>“What are you looking at her for?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to see her.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to see her for?”</p>

<p>“I take an interest in boats,” I answered, not caring
to be very communicative with the scion of the Wimpletons.</p>

<p>It immediately occurred to me that Waddie’s business
at Ruoara was the same as my own, and my heart
sank within me, for I could not hope to bid against
one who had so much money at his command. But I
could not think, for the life of me, why Waddie should
want the boat, for he had one of about the same size,
which was his own private property. Probably he had
taken a fancy to her, as I had.</p>

<p>“Are you going to buy her, Wolf?” asked he, with
more interest than he was accustomed to manifest in
anything.</p>

<p>“That will depend upon circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Who told you that I was going to buy this boat?”
demanded he sharply.</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“You came up to bid against me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were coming till I saw you
here.”</p>

<p>“If you bid against me, Wolf Penniman, I’ll be the
death of you.”</p>

<p>“I think not,” I replied, laughing at this rash threat.</p>

<p>“I will! You will find me an uglier customer to
deal with than you did Tom Toppleton. Do you think
I’m going to have you dogging my steps wherever
I go?”</p>

<p>I could only laugh.</p>

<p>“No one about here wants the boat but me,” he
added.</p>

<p>“I want her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you want her only because I do,”
snarled he.</p>

<p>“It’s an open thing, I suppose. This is a public
auction; and if you are willing to give more than I
can, of course you will have her,” I replied.</p>

<p>“If you don’t bid against me, she will be knocked
off at the first offer.”</p>

<p>“We won’t quarrel, Waddie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will, if you bid against me. The auctioneer<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
is coming. You mind what I say. If you bid
against me, you will repent it as long as you live.”</p>

<p>Such language from an ordinary boy would have
been very remarkable; from Waddie it was not at all
so. It was his usual style of bullying. It seemed
very strange that the young gentleman should attempt
to bully me into silence when he could outbid me; but
I ascertained afterward that his father objected to
buying the boat, and even refused to furnish the
money, so that Waddie could only bid to the extent
of the funds then in his possession. However weak
and indulgent the colonel was, he had not sunk into
the condition of subserviency to his son into which the
major had fallen.</p>

<p>The auctioneer, followed by only a small portion of
the crowd from the house, approached the spot where
Waddie stood. I jumped ashore, and secured a place
on the wall. The auctioneer took his stand on the
stern of the <em>Belle</em>; but none of the attendants upon
the sale felt interest enough to go on board, or even to
examine the craft. It was plain enough that the competition
lay between Waddie and myself alone. I
had made up my mind to lose the boat, and I felt<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
badly about it. I could not expect to bid successfully
against the son of the rich man. However, I meant
to try, and I only hoped that Waddie would keep his
temper. He had certainly given me fair warning; but
perhaps it was my misfortune that I did not happen to
be afraid of him.</p>

<p>While I stood there, I could not help thinking that
I was spoiling all my chances of a situation in the
future on board of the <em>Ucayga</em>, if the colonel should
again be disposed to repeat his munificent offers. But
I had a dream of doing even a better thing with the
<em>Belle</em> than I could on board of the steamer or on the
Lake Shore Railroad, and without being subject to the
caprices of either of the young gentlemen who were
so potent in both.</p>

<p>The auctioneer gave us a grandiloquent description
of the “fairy pleasure barge” which was before us.
He was not a nautical man, and sadly bungled in his
terms. She was the fastest sailer on the lake; was a
good sea-boat. She was right and tight in every respect.</p>

<p>“For, gentlemen,” he added facetiously, “a boat,
unlike a man, is a good deal better when she is tight<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
than when she is not tight”&mdash;a witticism at which the
auctioneer laughed much more heartily than the auditors.
“She is copper-fastened, besides being fastened
to the wall. Like myself, and some of you, gentlemen,
she is very sharp. And now, how much am I offered
for this magnificent yacht, the finest, without exception,
on the lake. What shall I have for her?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five dollars,” said Waddie Wimpleton,
who could not conceal his interest and anxiety in the
result.</p>

<p>“Did you say twenty-five dollars, Mr. Wimpleton?”
said the auctioneer, with a look which was intended to
manifest his astonishment at the smallness of the bid.
“Why, she cost over six hundred dollars! You can’t
mean that, Mr. Wimpleton.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do mean it!” said Waddie smartly.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five dollars is bid for this splendid yacht,
sharp as a Yankee pedler, and copper-fastened, besides
being fastened to the wall. Who says a hundred?”</p>

<p>No one said a hundred. No one said anything for a
few moments, during which time the auctioneer dwelt
upon the beautiful proportions of the craft, and repeated
his jokes for a third time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“Only twenty-five dollars is bid for the <em>Belle</em>! Why,
gentlemen, that would not pay for one of her sails.”</p>

<p>“Thirty dollars,” I added.</p>

<p>“Thirty dollars!” repeated the auctioneer, glancing
curiously at me. “Perhaps I ought to say that the
conditions of this sale are cash on delivery. Thirty
dollars! Shall I have a hundred?”</p>

<p>Waddie glanced furiously at me, and I saw that his
fists were clenched.</p>

<p>“Thirty-five,” said he.</p>

<p>“Forty.”</p>

<p>“Forty-five,” snapped he.</p>

<p>“Fifty,” I added quietly.</p>

<p>I had hardly uttered the word before Waddie’s fist
was planted squarely on the end of my nose, and the
blood spurted from it. He was about to follow it up
with another, when I deemed it necessary to do something.
I parried his stroke, and hit him so fairly in
the eye that he reeled, lost his balance, and went over
backwards into the lake with a fearful splash.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ON BOARD THE “BELLE.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Somehow, when we resort to violence, we often do
much more than we intend. I did not desire to do
anything more than defend myself; but Waddie stood
between me and the water, and when I hit him, he
went over. I have never claimed to be saint or angel.
I was human enough to “get mad” when the young
gentleman flattened my nose and made it bleed. I
simply defended myself by the only means within my
power, though I did not intend to throw Waddie into
the lake.</p>

<p>The water was not more than three or four feet deep
near the wall; but Waddie might have been drowned
in it, if he had not been promptly assisted by the auctioneer
and others. But if the water was not deep, it
was cold, and hydropathy is an excellent remedy for
overheated blood.</p>

<p>“That’s the way Wolf fights,” said Waddie, as he
shook the water from his clothes.</p>

<p>“He served you right,” replied the auctioneer, who,<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
I believe, did not belong to Ruoara&mdash;certainly not to
Centreport.</p>

<p>“Do you call this fair play?” demanded Waddie,
with chattering teeth.</p>

<p>“To be sure I do. You turned on him, and hit him
without any warning,” retorted the auctioneer. “He
hit you back, and paid you in your own coin. You
went over into the lake, but that was not his fault.
Fifty dollars is bid for this beautiful boat, that cost
over six hundred.”</p>

<p>“I told him I would be the death of him if he bid
against me,” replied Waddie; but there was not much
life in his words.</p>

<p>“O, ho! you did&mdash;did you? Well, I’m glad he
knocked you into the lake; and if I had known what
you told him, you might have staid in the lake for all
me,” added the auctioneer indignantly, for the greatest
sin in his estimation was a conspiracy to suppress bidding
at an auction. “Fifty dollars! Shall I have
sixty?”</p>

<p>Waddie lingered on the wall, shivering with the
cold; but, to my astonishment, he did not make any
additional bid. I could not understand it. The auctioneer<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
again called the attention of the audience to
the many virtues of the <em>Belle</em>, and then observed, in
piteous tones, that only fifty dollars was bid for the
beautiful craft.</p>

<p>“I haven’t done with you yet, Wolf Penniman,”
said Waddie, creeping up to me.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you will finish with me as soon as
possible,” I replied, stepping back from the wall so as
not to afford him any temptation to push me into the
lake.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my word with you.”</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars!” stormed the auctioneer, justly indignant
at the sacrifice of the boat.</p>

<p>“When must it be paid for?” demanded Waddie.</p>

<p>“Cash on delivery,” replied the auctioneer sharply.</p>

<p>“Can it be delivered to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“No; the sale must be closed to-day. Fifty dollars!”</p>

<p>“Sixty,” said Waddie, with an ugly glance at me,
after one of the bystanders had whispered a word to
him, to the effect, I suppose, that he would lend him
ten dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>“Sixty-five,” I added quietly.</p>

<p>“Sixty-five!” repeated the auctioneer, more hopefully.</p>

<p>Waddie was beginning to warm up again, and had
actually ceased to shiver. He spoke to the bystander
with whom he was acquainted, and then bid seventy
dollars. I immediately advanced to seventy-five.</p>

<p>“Seventy-five!” shouted the auctioneer. “Gentlemen,
this is a shameful sacrifice of valuable property.”</p>

<p>I saw Waddie’s friend shake his head, as though he
was not willing to risk more than twenty dollars on
the speculation; but while the young gentleman was
arguing the point with him, the <em>Belle</em> was struck off to
me. The scion of the house of Wimpleton swore like
a bad boy when this result was reached. He shook
his fist at me, and raised a laugh among the bystanders,
not all of whom appeared to reverence the idol
which had been set up in Centreport. My purchase included
the small boat which served as a tender to the
<em>Belle</em>, the mooring-buoy, and other appurtenances.</p>

<p>The auctioneer’s clerk gave me a bill of sale of the
boat, and I paid the cash on the spot. I was the happiest
young man on the shore of the lake. Waddie<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
had disappeared as soon as the sale was completed,
and I was subjected to no further annoyance from him.
Having finished my business in Ruoara, I was ready to
sail for home, and astonish the Middleporters with the
sight of my purchase.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine boat you have bought,” said one of
the half-dozen persons who stood on the wall watching
my movements.</p>

<p>I looked up and saw that the speaker was Dick
Bayard, a Wimpletonian, and the senior captain in the
Centreport Battalion. He was a leading spirit among
the students on his side of the lake. He had been the
actual, though not the nominal, leader in the war on
the Horse Shoe, and had distinguished himself by his
energy and enterprise in that memorable conflict. His
father lived in Ruoara, which accounted for his appearance
there when the institute was in session. I
had a great deal of respect for him, after I saw how
well he bore himself in the silly war, though he had
always been a strong and unreasonable supporter of
Waddie, and had aided him in persecuting me before I
was driven out of Centreport.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is a first-rate boat,” I replied; for speaking<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
well of my boat was even better than speaking
well of my dog.</p>

<p>“Are you going down to Middleport now?”</p>

<p>“Yes; right off.”</p>

<p>“Will you take a passenger?” he asked, rather
diffidently.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Myself.”</p>

<p>“I will, with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Wolf.”</p>

<p>I pushed the tender up to the wall, and he stepped
into it.</p>

<p>“Some of the fellows say you are not a bit like
other boys, Wolf; and I begin to think they are more
than half-right,” said Dick Bayard, as he came on
board of the <em>Belle</em>.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. I don’t suppose I’m very different
from other fellows,” I replied, with becoming
modesty.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to have a grudge against any one.
If a fellow abuses you, you treat him as well as ever.
You knock him over in self-defense, and then behave
toward him just as though nothing had happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>“I think I can afford to do so.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you would let me sail up the lake
with you,” laughed he.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Like a good many other fellows, I have toadied to
Waddie Wimpleton, and helped him hunt you down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about that now.”</p>

<p>“I see you don’t. Can I help you?” he asked, as I
began to hoist the mainsail.</p>

<p>“You may take the peak-halyard, if you please.”</p>

<p>We hoisted the jib and mainsail, and stood up the
lake with a gentle breeze. I took the elaborately carved
tiller in my hand, and if ever a young man was
proud of his boat, his name was Wolfert Penniman.
The <em>Belle</em> fully realized all even of the auctioneer’s enthusiastic
description.</p>

<p>“Don’t you belong to the institute now, Dick?” I
asked, after we had said all that it was necessary to
say in praise of the <em>Belle</em>, and after my companion had
related to me more of her history than I knew before.</p>

<p>“Not much,” said he, laughing; “my name is still
on the books, and I am still captain of Company A,<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
Wimpleton Battalion; but I don’t go to school half
the time.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” I asked curiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. Since the steamboat company
was formed, Waddie has put on so many airs that
some of us can’t stand it. In fact, our president does
not treat us much better than he did you.”</p>

<p>“That is unfortunate for you, and still more so for
him.”</p>

<p>“They say the Toppletonians are down upon
Tommy; but I am inclined to think the feeling is
worse on our side than on yours. Waddie is the most
unpopular fellow on our side of the lake.”</p>

<p>“I have often wondered how you fellows, whose
fathers are rich men, could let Waddie lord it over you
as he does. My father is a poor man, but I can’t
stand it.”</p>

<p>“They won’t stand it much longer,” replied Dick,
shaking his head. “Our fellows have had about
enough of it.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t exactly know, and, if I did, I suppose
it would not be prudent to tell you,” laughed Dick.<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
“They are going to turn him out of office, for one
thing.”</p>

<p>“I think that would do him good. That same thing
will happen to Tommy Toppleton at the next election.”</p>

<p>“Waddie got into a row the other day with a lot of
fellows that don’t belong to the institute. He undertook
to drive them off the ground where they were
playing, near the town school. They wouldn’t go, and
one of them, a plucky little fellow, spoke his mind
pretty freely to him. Waddie and one of his cronies
caught him the next day and gave him a cowhiding.
The town fellows mean to pay him off, and I know
they will.”</p>

<p>“They will only get into trouble. Waddie’s father
will stand by him,” I added.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what they mean to do.”</p>

<p>“What did Waddie want to drive the town fellows
off the ground for?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“They were playing ball, and Waddie wanted the
ground to have a game with his friends.”</p>

<p>“Whose ground was it?”</p>

<p>“It was the piece of land called the school pasture,
and belongs to the town. You know where it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“I know the place.”</p>

<p>“One party had just as good a right to the ground
as the other; but you know how Waddie does things.
If he wants anything he takes it, and makes a row if
everybody don’t yield to him.”</p>

<p>“That’s his style.”</p>

<p>“But don’t say anything about what I’ve said, please.
If anything happens to Waddie, it will be laid to these
fellows.”</p>

<p>“They ought to have been smart enough to keep
still themselves,” I replied.</p>

<p>“One of them told me about it in confidence. I
shouldn’t have said anything to you, if you lived on
our side now.”</p>

<p>“I won’t say anything.”</p>

<p>I was not likely to think anything more about it,
and still less to meddle with the affair.</p>

<p>“We are tired of this thing on our side of the lake,”
continued Dick. “If we had twenty fellows that would
serve Waddie as you did to-day, when he pitched into
you, we might make a decent fellow of him after a
while. For my own part, I don’t mean to take a word
of lip from him. If he insults me, I shall give him as<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
good as he sends. Indeed, I have done so once or
twice, and he hates me like poison for it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you make anything by using hard
words.”</p>

<p>“What do you do, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that abusive language does me any
harm, and I mean to be good-natured, whatever happens;
though, when it comes to hitting me in the face,
and giving me a bloody nose, I can’t quite stand that,
and I defend myself as vigorously as I know how. I
think a fellow can be a gentleman without putting his
neck under anybody’s heel.”</p>

<p>I landed Dick Bayard at Centreport, and stood over
to the other side of the lake. I moored the <em>Belle</em> in a
little bay not far from my father’s house, and went
home to report my good fortune.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">IN THE PICNIC GROVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Of course I thought of but little except my boat
after she came into my possession, and before the day
closed I had exhibited her to all who felt an interest
in such matters. My father was delighted with her,
and congratulated me on the bargain I had made.
Tom Walton declared that the <em>Belle</em> was the finest
craft on the lake. Before night, so thoroughly had
my boat been talked up in Middleport, I had a party
engaged for the next day, to visit the fishing-grounds.</p>

<p>After seeing the boat, and discussing the matter
with my father, I had the conscience to fix the price
of her at seven dollars a day, which included my own
services. When a gentleman spoke of engaging her
for a week or more, I told him he should have her for
five dollars a day for any longer period than three
days.</p>

<p>The weather was very warm and pleasant for October,
and my first trip to the fishing-grounds was a
great success. My party were delighted with the boat,<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
and I did all I could to make them comfortable. The
gentlemen had a good time, and spoke so favorably
of the <em>Belle</em> and of me, that the person who proposed
to go for a week closed the bargain with me, and I was
engaged to start on Monday morning. I was in a fair
way to get back, before the season closed, what I had
paid for the boat.</p>

<p>On Saturday I had no engagement; but I found it
quite impossible to keep out of the <em>Belle</em>. I intended
to go on an exploring expedition up the lake, in order
to find some good landing-places. I went after Tom
Walton, to give him an invitation to accompany me;
but I found he was at work for a day or two in one of
the stores. The wind blew quite fresh from the northwest,
and the lake was tolerably rough, which made
me the more desirous of testing the qualities of the
<em>Belle</em>.</p>

<p>While I was reefing down the mainsail, I saw the
<em>Highflyer</em> pass the Narrows, headed up the lake. This
was Waddie Wimpleton’s boat. She was about the
size of the <em>Belle</em>, and I could not see why the young
gentleman wanted the latter. The <em>Highflyer</em> would
certainly have satisfied me, though in the course of the<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
day I was better informed in regard to his motives.
Waddie had reefed his mainsail, and was going at a
rapid rate up the lake.</p>

<p>I had no wish to come into collision with him,
though I was rather anxious to know which boat could
make the best time. He was alone; indeed, I had
often noticed that he sailed without any company;
and, as neither of the institutes was in session on
Saturdays, I had often seen him bound up the lake on
that day. He had the reputation of being a good
boatman, and certainly he had had experience enough
to qualify him to act in that capacity.</p>

<p>I cast off the moorings of the <em>Belle</em>, and stood out
into the lake, where I could get the full benefit of the
wind. Waddie was some distance ahead of me; but
I soon saw that his eye was upon me. I intended to
keep well over on the west side of the lake, so as to
avoid him. I needed not the express declaration he
had made to assure me that he hated me, and that he
would use all possible means to annoy and punish me.
Although I was not afraid of him, I did not wish to
afford him any opportunity to gratify his malignity
upon me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>He sailed the <em>Highflyer</em> very well. Every minute
he glanced at the <em>Belle</em>, to ascertain what progress she
was making. Probably he supposed that I had put off
for the sole purpose of racing with him, which, however,
was not true, though I was very glad of a chance
to measure paces with him. Neither of us was obliged
to wait long for a decided result, for in half an hour
from the time I started, the two boats were abreast of
each other, though still half a mile apart. Then the
reason why he wished to purchase the <em>Belle</em> was apparent.
She was faster than the <em>Highflyer</em>; and Waddie
did not enjoy being beaten by any boat on the
lake.</p>

<p>Though I was not near enough to observe the effect
upon him, I had no doubt he was foaming and fuming
with wrath at the audacity of a poor boy like me, who
ventured to beat him. While I was walking by him
with perfect ease, he threw his boat up into the wind,
and turned out the reef in the mainsail. The wind
was freshening every hour, and I regarded this as a
very imprudent step on his part. In fact, I began to
feel that I might, in some way, be held responsible for
any disaster which should happen to him, if by racing<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
with him I goaded him on to any rashness. I therefore
came about, and began to beat down the lake, to
assure him that I was not inclined to race under whole
sail in such a blow.</p>

<p>When he had shaken out his reef, however, he gave
chase to me. The <em>Highflyer</em> labored heavily in the
rough waves, and I was not sure that the duty of
rescuing her rash skipper from a watery grave would
not soon devolve upon me. He followed, and having
all sail on his boat, he gained upon me on the wind.
At this rate he would soon be crowing over me, and,
the reputation of the <em>Belle</em> would be injured. I was
averse to being beaten, even under a reefed mainsail.
I let out my sheet, and stood over toward the eastern
shore. Waddie followed me, and as I could not now
decline the race on his terms, I soon headed the <em>Belle</em>
up the lake.</p>

<p>By the time I had laid my course, the <em>Highflyer</em> was
abreast of me. Now both of us had the wind on the
quarter. A boat on the wind, with all sail set, can be
better handled than when going before it. I saw the
<em>Highflyer</em> plunging down deep into the waves; but I<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
suppose Waddie had not learned that a boat overpressed
in a blow does not make any better time than
one carrying just sail enough to make her go comfortably,
without wasting her headway in dives and
plunges. On this tack he no longer gained upon me.
On the contrary, it was soon evident that the <em>Belle</em>
was running away from him. My boat was good for
at least one more mile in five than the <em>Highflyer</em>.</p>

<p>I ran away from Waddie, and went up the lake as
far as Gulfport. I soon lost sight of him, and I concluded
that he had made a landing somewhere on the
shore. It was too rough to explore the coast, for the
wind was driving the waves upon the rocks and
beaches with savage power, and it was not prudent
to go too near the land. I put the <em>Belle</em> about, and
commenced beating down the lake. I thought no
more of Waddie, my mind being wholly taken up in
sailing my boat, and in the pleasant anticipation of
making a profitable thing of her.</p>

<p>On the eastern shore of the lake, between Centreport
and Gulfport, there was a wood, covering, perhaps,
a square mile of land. It was much used by picnic<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
parties in the summer, and had a cook-house for
frying fish and making chowders. A rude landing-place
had been prepared for steamers, for the deep
water extended quite up to the shore. In the process
of beating the <em>Belle</em> down the lake, I ran her close up
to the pier off the grove. As I was coming about, I
heard a cry which seemed to indicate great distress.
I was startled by the sound; but, as there were neither
Indians nor wild beasts in the vicinity, I concluded
that I had mistaken the nature of the call.</p>

<p>I was proceeding on my course when the cry was
repeated. It was certainly the sound of mingled anger
and distress. I threw the <em>Belle</em> up into the wind, and
listened. The cry was repeated, and I stood in toward
the shore. Passing the pier, I saw Waddie’s boat secured
to the logs. Just above the wharf there was a
little land-locked bay, into which I ran the <em>Belle</em>. The
cry of distress was not again repeated; but my curiosity
was fully aroused. I concluded that Waddie had
found some boy or girl, smaller and weaker than himself,
and was exercising the evil propensities of his
nature upon his victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>I lowered my sails, and secured them. Fastening
the painter of the <em>Belle</em> to a tree, I walked toward the
cook-house, with the small boat-hook, not bigger than
a broom-handle, in my hand. I must say that I
dreaded a conflict of any description with Mr. Waddie.
There was no more reason in him than in a stone
wall, and he really delighted in torturing a victim. If
any one interfered to repress his cruelty, he took the
act as a personal insult, and regarded himself as oppressed
by not being allowed to exercise his malice
upon the weak.</p>

<p>I walked cautiously toward the spot from which the
cry had come, for I wished to obtain a view of the
situation before I was seen myself. The trees were
large, and afforded me abundant concealment. Every
few moments I stopped to listen; and I soon heard
several voices, some of them peculiarly gruff and unnatural.
It was plain that Waddie and his victim
were not the only actors in the scene. Placing myself
behind a tree, I took a careful observation, and discovered
smoke rising among the branches; but I could
not yet see who the speakers were. Something was<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
going on; but whether it was a comedy or a tragedy
I could not determine.</p>

<p>I continued cautiously to approach the spot, and
soon gained a position where I could obtain a full view
of the scene. I had expected to find Waddie persecuting
some poor wretch. The “boot was on the
other leg.” The scion of the house of Wimpleton was
the victim, and not the oppressor. The world seemed
to be turned upside down. Waddie, divested of all
his clothing but his shirt and pants, was tied to a tree.
Near him a fire was snapping and crackling, while over
it hung a kettle. Although I was at the windward of
the fire, the odor which pervaded the woods assured
me that the kettle was filled with tar.</p>

<p>Around the fire were four stout boys, rigged out in
fantastic garments, their faces covered with masks and
other devices to conceal their identity. Near the fire
lay a couple of bolsters, which, no doubt, were filled
with feathers. One of these fellows was stirring the
contents of the kettle, and another was replenishing
the fire, while the other two looked on. Who they
were I could form no idea, for their strange uniforms
completely disguised them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>Waddie looked like the very picture of hopeless
misery. I had never seen such an aspect of utter despair
on his face. He was as pale as death, and I
could even see the tremors of his frame as he trembled
with terror.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE BATTLE WITH WORDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I was not quite willing to believe that the four stout
fellows in the vicinity of the kettle really intended to
“tar and feather” Waddie Wimpleton. In the first
place, it was astounding that any one on the Centreport
side of the lake should have the audacity to conceive
such an outrage upon the sacred person of the
magnate’s only son. Why, the people generally held
the great man in about the same reverence as the
people of England hold their queen. The idea of committing
any indignity upon his person, or upon the persons
of any of his family, seemed too monstrous to be
entertained.</p>

<p>I judged that the scene before me was the sequel to
the incident of which Dick Bayard had told me. But
the actors were Centreporters, and it was amazing to
think that even four boys in the whole town could
actually undertake to revenge themselves upon Mr.
Waddie. All that I had done in my quarrel with him<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
was in self-defense, and the scene transpiring before
me was quite incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Perhaps what Dick Bayard had told me in some
measure explained the situation. It was a fact that
the students of the Wimpleton Institute were in a
state of rebellion so far as Waddie was concerned, and
the influence of this spirit had doubtless extended
beyond the borders of the academy. If the Wimpletonians
were audacious enough to think of mutiny
against the young lordling, it was not strange that
others, not immediately associated with him, should
even outdo their own intentions.</p>

<p>The particular school where Waddie had driven the
boys from their ball-grounds was near the outskirts of
the village, and was attended by the sons of some of
the farmers living far enough from the center of influence
to be in a measure beyond its sphere. After all,
perhaps it is really more singular that any American
boys could be found who would submit to the tyranny
and domineering of Waddie, than that a few should
be found who were willing to resist it to the last extremity.</p>

<p>Strange as the phenomenon seemed to be to one<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
who for years had witnessed the homage paid to
Waddie Wimpleton and Tommy Toppleton, the fact
was undeniable. The little magnate of Centreport
was there, bound fast to a tree. The young ruffians,
who were so intent upon retaliating for the injury
inflicted upon them, had probably lain in wait at this
unfrequented place, perhaps for several weeks. I had
heard the screams of their victim when they captured
him, and I was sure that he had not yielded without
a rugged resistance.</p>

<p>The fire blazed under the tar-kettle, and the preparations
were rapidly progressing. I kept in my
hiding-place, and watched with breathless interest the
proceedings. So completely were the actors disguised
that I could not recognize a single one of them. So
far as Waddie was concerned, I could not be supposed
to have any deep interest in his fate. Perhaps the
humiliating and disgusting operation which the ruffians
intended to perform would do him good.</p>

<p>I ought to say here that the newspapers, at about
this time, were filled with the details of such an indignity
inflicted upon an obnoxious person in another
part of the country. Probably some of these boys had<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
read the account, and it had suggested to them a
suitable punishment for Waddie. I had seen the narrative
myself, but only with contempt for the persecutors,
and sympathy for their victim.</p>

<p>Certainly these boys had no right to inflict such an
outrage upon Waddie. Though he had been no friend
of mine, and though, on the contrary, he gloried in
being my enemy, I pitied him. If I did anything for
him, it would be just like him to kick me the next day
for my pains. I had stumbled upon the scene by accident,
but it seemed to me that I had a duty to perform&mdash;a
duty from which my unpleasant relations
with the victim did not absolve me.</p>

<p>Should I interfere to prevent this indignity? My
mother was not present, but it seemed to me that I
could hear her voice saying to me, in the gentlest of
tones, “Love your enemies.” I saw her before me,
reading from the New Testament the divine message.
Then she seemed to look up from the book, and say to
me, “Wolfert, if Christ could forgive and bless even
those who sought to slay Him, can you not lift one of
your fingers to help one who has wronged you?”</p>

<p>The duty seemed to be very plain, though I could<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
not help thinking that Waddie would insult me the
next moment after I had served him, just as Tommy
Toppleton had done when I rescued him from his captors
on the lake. No matter! I must do my duty,
whether he did his or not. I was responsible for my
own actions, not for his.</p>

<p>This conclusion was happily reached; but then it
was not so easy to act upon its behests. Four stout
fellows were before me, either of whom was a full
match for me. What could I do against the whole of
them? Perhaps nothing; perhaps I could not save
Waddie from his fate; but it was none the less my
duty to try, even at the expense of some hard knocks.
I had the little boat-hook in my hand. It was an insignificant
weapon with which to fight four times my
own force. But somehow I felt that I was in the
right; I felt the inspiration of a desire to do a good
deed, and I had a vague assurance that help would in
some manner come to me, though from what direction
I could not imagine, for at this season of the year few
people ever visited the picnic grove.</p>

<p>Leaving the shadow of the tree, which had concealed
me from the young ruffians, I walked boldly<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
toward them. The tramp of my feet on the crackling
sticks instantly attracted their attention. To my great
satisfaction they suddenly retreated into a little thicket
near the tar-kettle.</p>

<p>“Save me, Wolf! Save me!” cried Waddie, in
tones of the most abject despondency. “Save me, and
I will be your best friend.”</p>

<p>I did not believe in any promises he could make;
but I directed my steps toward him, with the intention
of releasing him.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted one of the boys, in a singularly
gruff voice, which afforded me no clue to the owner’s
identity.</p>

<p>I halted and looked toward the thicket.</p>

<p>“It’s only Wolf Penniman,” said one of the party,
who spoke behind the mask that covered his face.
“It’s all right. He’ll help us do it.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” I demanded, pretty
sharply.</p>

<p>“We are only paying off Waddie. Will you help
us, Wolf?” replied one of the conspirators.</p>

<p>“No, certainly not. You have no right to meddle
with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we are going to do it, whether we have
any right or not. We will tar and feather him, as sure
as he lives.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” I asked innocently.</p>

<p>“No matter who we are. Has Waddie any right to
insult us? Has he any right to cowhide a fellow
smaller than he is, within an inch of his life?”</p>

<p>“No; but two wrongs don’t make a right, anyhow
you can fix it. Don’t you think it is mean for four
great fellows like you to set upon one, and abuse
him?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any meaner than what Waddie did, anyhow.
We mean to teach him that he can’t trample
upon us fellows, and drive us around like slaves. We
have stood this thing long enough, and we mean to
show him that the knife cuts both ways,” replied the
fellow with the gruffest voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t see it. I haven’t any doubt Waddie has
imposed upon you; but I think he has used me as
badly as he ever did any other fellow. I don’t believe
in this sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I never will do it again, Wolf, if you will save me
this time,” pleaded poor Waddie, in piteous tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s none of your business, Wolf Penniman,
and you can leave,” added the speaker.</p>

<p>“I think you had better let Waddie go this time.
I’ll go bail for him, if you will,” I continued good-naturedly,
for I was not disposed to provoke a conflict
with the ruffians.</p>

<p>“Not if we know it! We have watched too long to
catch him to let him go now,” replied the gruff-toned
ruffian, emerging from the bushes, followed by his
companions.</p>

<p>They halted between Waddie and me, and I tried to
make out who they were; but they were so effectually
disguised that all my scrutiny was baffled. I have
since come to the conclusion that I had never been
acquainted with them, and so far as I know, no one
ever found out who they were. I resorted to the most
persuasive rhetoric in my power to induce the boys
to forego their purpose; but they were obdurate and
inflexible. I tried to give them a Sunday-school lesson,
and they laughed at me. I endeavored to point out
to them the consequences of the act, assuring them
that Colonel Wimpleton would leave no measure untried
to discover and punish them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll risk all that,” replied the leading ruffian impatiently.
“Now, dry up, Wolf Penniman. We don’t
wish any harm to you; but you shall not spoil this
game. Come, fellows, bring up the tar-kettle.”</p>

<p>The wretch went up to Waddie, whose hands were
tied behind him, and began to pull off his shirt. The
unhappy victim uttered the most piercing screams,
and struggled like a madman to break away from the
tree.</p>

<p>“This thing has gone far enough,” I interposed indignantly,
as a couple of the rascals took the tar-kettle
from the fire, and began to carry it towards the
tree.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it?” blustered the
chief of the party.</p>

<p>“I am going to stop it,” I replied smartly.</p>

<p>“I guess not! If you don’t take yourself off, we’ll
give you a coat of the same color.”</p>

<p>I rushed up to the two boys who were carrying the
kettle, and began to demonstrate pretty freely with
the boat-hook. They placed their burden on the
ground, and stood by to defend it. I hooked into it
with my weapon, and upset it.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE BATTLE WITH BLOWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The gruff-voiced conspirator rushed furiously toward
me, and I retreated a few paces. The two in
charge of the tar-kettle picked it up, and saved a portion
of its contents. My heavy assailant was roused
to a high pitch of anger by the opposition I made to
his plans, and seemed to be disposed to proceed to extremities.
He had picked up a club, and continued to
advance. Once or twice he made a pass at me with
his weapon, but I dodged the blow.</p>

<p>I was not angry, and I was cool. I saw that my foe
was clumsy, if he was stout. As he threw his heavy
cow-hide boots about, he reminded me of an elephant
dancing a hornpipe. I saw two or three chances to hit
him, but I refrained from doing so, for I did not want
a broken head upon my conscience.</p>

<p>“Come here, Martin!” shouted he to one of his fellow-conspirators;
and this was the only name I heard
used during the whole of the strife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you knock him?” demanded the person
called, as he sprang forward to assist the big fellow.</p>

<p>I continued to retreat, and intended to fall back upon
my boat for protection; but the second assailant got in
behind me, and presently I saw more stars than I was
anxious to behold in broad daylight. I concluded that
I was a fool to indulge in squeamishness on such an
occasion, when my head was in danger of being “caved
in” by the heavy blows of the rascals. Besides, the
rap I had received had a tendency to rouse my ire; in
fact, it did rouse it; and at the next convenient opportunity,
I struck the big fellow a smart blow on the
head. Evidently it hit him in a tender place, for he
dropped flat upon the ground.</p>

<p>I was alarmed at this catastrophe, and fortunately
the second assailant was affected in the same way. I
had secured a position where I could not be attacked
in the rear, and having disposed of the heaviest of my
foes, I turned upon the other. The fate of his companion
was a salutary lesson to him, and he retired to
the side of the fallen champion.</p>

<p>But the big fellow was not so badly damaged as I
had feared. He was not even stunned, and soon<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
sprang to his feet, rubbing his head, and endeavoring
to collect his scattered ideas. My own head felt as
though a cannon-ball had dropped upon it. I took off
my cap and examined the place with my hand. There
was a big “bump” on the side of my head to certify
the damage I had received.</p>

<p>“Come up here, fellows!” shouted the leader in the
enterprise, with a savage oath, when he had in some
measure recovered from the shock of the blow I had
given him.</p>

<p>They arranged their disguises anew, and held a
consultation. I could not hear what they said, but I
knew that I was the subject of their remarks. Each
of them then provided himself with a club, and I
realized that they intended to make an organized attack
upon me. If they captured me, my chances of
being tarred and feathered were about as good as
those of Waddie. It would have been the most prudent
thing I could do to retire from the field, and permit
the party to carry out their vicious purpose upon
the little magnate of Centreport. Though I had been
“punished” as much as I cared for, I felt so much
interest in the affair that I was not willing to leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>I saw two of the party, who had not before been
engaged, start at a smart run, with the evident intention
of getting between me and the water. I broke
into a run myself, and made for the boat. Jumping
on board, I pushed her off far enough to save me from
molestation. But then I observed that the other two
ruffians had not engaged in the pursuit. The two who
had done so stationed themselves on the bank of the
lake, and appeared to be so well satisfied that I began
to think something was wrong.</p>

<p>Suddenly it flashed upon my mind that the big fellow
intended to outwit me; that he and his companion
would do the dirty job while my two guards kept me
at a safe distance. Having put my hand to the plow,
I had too much pride, if not principle, to permit myself
to be outflanked in this manner. As the case now
stood, the big ruffian had won the battle. I was disgusted
with myself, and hastened to retrieve the mistake
I had made. I pushed the boat in toward the
shore, and my two sentinels stepped down to meet me.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine boat you have, Wolf,” said one of
them good-naturedly, as he leaped on the half-deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>The other one followed him, and I deemed it wise
to pick up my boat-hook.</p>

<p>“She is fine enough,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Will you let us look at her?” said the speaker,
winking at the other.</p>

<p>What did he wink for? That was what I wanted
to know. Why were they so good-natured? It was
not a very difficult problem, after all. Why should
they not be good-natured, if they could keep me where
I was while their companions did their vile work upon
Waddie? They were smart&mdash;they were!</p>

<p>“Certainly you may look at her, if you like,” I replied
very pleasantly, all of a sudden, for I intended
to be as smart as I could.</p>

<p>“They say you are a first-rate fellow, Wolf,” continued
the one who had first stepped on board, as he
jumped down into the standing-room, where I was.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am!”</p>

<p>“I can’t see why you stick up for such a mean boy
as Waddie Wimpleton.”</p>

<p>“I don’t stick up for him. I only like to see a fellow
have fair play,” I replied, seating myself, as
though I had nothing more to desire or hope for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>“He don’t give anybody fair play. This is about
the best boat I ever saw,” the speaker added, as he
looked into the little cabin.</p>

<p>“She is first-rate,” I answered carelessly.</p>

<p>“Cabin, beds, carpet, stove.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there is a chance to set a table there,” I
went on, after the second guard had contrived to push
the boat away from the shore, as he supposed, without
attracting my attention. “Go in, if you like, and I
will show you how we dine on board of the <em>Belle</em>.”</p>

<p>I spoke with becoming enthusiasm about the boat
and her fixtures, and I think my guests believed that
they had drawn away my attention from Waddie. At
any rate, the first speaker went into the cabin, and,
at my suggestion, the second one followed him.</p>

<p>“Now, do you see that board which is turned up
against the mast?” I proceeded, as I pointed to the
table.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it.”</p>

<p>“Well, just turn the button and let it down.”</p>

<p>It stuck pretty tight, as I knew it would, and both
of them took hold to lower the board. While they<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
were thus engaged, I drew the slide and banged the
doors to, before they suspected what I was doing.
Slipping in the padlock, I locked it, and while my
guards were turning the table in the cabin, I performed
the same office outside. They were prisoners,
and I felt that I might reasonably expect to find them
where I had left them. They might damage the
cabin of the <em>Belle</em>, but that was all they could do.</p>

<p>I hauled the boat in, and, as I leaped on shore, I
heard another piercing scream from Waddie, which
assured me that the tragedy had been renewed. I
leaped on the land, and, with the boat-hook still in
my hand, hastened to the scene of active operations.
As I approached the spot I saw the two ruffians tearing
Waddie’s clothes from his back, in readiness to
apply the tar-swab. The wretched victim screamed
piteously. I saw that I had no time to trifle with
the affair. I decided to be the aggressor this time.
I rushed furiously at the big fellow whom I had hit
before. He did not see me till I was within fifty feet
of him. He had laid aside his club, and I “pitched
in.” I dealt him a heavy blow on the side of his
head, and he retreated to the place where he had left<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
his weapon. I made at the other one then; but the
terrors of the boat-hook were too much for him, and
he fled to obtain his club.</p>

<p>While they were falling back upon their ammunition
I took my knife from my pocket, and, rushing up
to the tree, cut the cord which confined Waddie. He
was free; but his hands were still tied together. I
told him to follow me; and, gaining a moment’s time,
I released his hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget this, Wolf,” said he. “I will not,
as true as I live.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got out of the scrape yet. Pick up
that stick, and keep close to me. We must fight it
out now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fight as long as I can stand,” he replied resolutely.</p>

<p>The fellow with the gruff voice swore like a pirate
when he saw that Waddie was free, and he and his
companion immediately gave chase to us. I had no
longer any reason to fight, and I was not disposed to
do so, except in self-defense; but I was determined to
bring off Waddie unharmed, whatever happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>We made a détour toward my boat, closely pursued
by the two ruffians, now foaming with rage at
the failure of their wicked scheme. We outran them,
and soon had placed a sufficient distance between us
and them to justify a halt. But we were not a great
way from the boat.</p>

<p>“What has become of the other two fellows?” asked
Waddie, puffing under the exhaustion of his hard
run.</p>

<p>“They are safe,” I replied; and involuntarily I put
my hand into my pocket, to search for the key of the
padlock on the cabin slide.</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>“In my boat, locked up in the cabin.”</p>

<p>I continued to fumble in my pockets for the key;
but I could not find it, and the conclusion was forced
upon me that I had stupidly left it in the lock. If my
two guards could not release themselves, this service
could easily be performed by their associates. I had
made a bad mistake; though, after all, the blunder
would only save them the trouble of breaking the
lock, and otherwise damaging the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>I found that keeping still was the best method of
baffling our pursuers, since they had evidently lost
sight of us. I heard their voices, but the sound receded,
and it was plain that they were moving toward
the lake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WADDIE AND I.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As nearly as I could judge in our place of concealment,
the big fellow, who was the leading spirit of
the conspirators, had been careful to keep the inside
line of retreat from the tar-kettle to the boat.
Of course, he expected us to retire in that direction;
but when we distanced him in the chase he had moved
directly to the water-side, while I had swept around
in a much larger circle. As soon as he lost sight of
us in the thick undergrowth, which had only been
cut away on a few acres composing the picnic-grounds,
he had made the shortest line for the boats.</p>

<p>“Where is your boat, Wolf?” asked Waddie, who
was actually trembling with apprehension, though I
could not blame him for being alarmed, since the villains
were still on his track, and still intent upon
subjecting him to the degrading ordeal.</p>

<p>“It lies about a quarter of a mile below yours, at
the wharf,” I replied to my trembling companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“We must keep still for a little while, till we see a
good chance to reach the boat.”</p>

<p>“I am cold, Wolf,” said he.</p>

<p>Perhaps he offered this as an explanation of his
shaking condition; but, although the weather was
pleasant for the season, it was still chilly enough to
render thick clothing quite comfortable. Above his
boots the poor fellow had on nothing but his shirt
and pants, and the former had been torn half-off by
the wretches who persecuted him. I took off the
heavy jacket I wore, and gave it to him.</p>

<p>“You will be cold yourself, Wolf,” said he, with a
degree of consideration of which I did not believe
him capable.</p>

<p>“No; I can get along very well. Put it on.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Wolf; you are very kind.”</p>

<p>Those were amazing words to be uttered by him
to me! But his father had been even more gentle,
and had apparently forgotten all about me in a few
days. He put on my coat, which fitted him very
well, and I buttoned it up to the throat for him. He
declared that it “felt good”; and I have no doubt it<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
did, for the driving wind upon his bare shoulders must
have been anything but comfortable.</p>

<p>“Do you know any of those fellows?” asked
Waddie.</p>

<p>“I do not. I heard the big fellow call one of the
others Martin, but I haven’t the least idea who any
of them are. I suppose they belong on your side of
the lake, and I haven’t seen much of the fellows there
lately,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Do you think they belong to our institute?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they do. They are coarser, rougher
fellows than the students on either side.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know who they are,” added
Waddie, compressing his lips and shaking his head.
“But whoever they are, if they don’t have to suffer for
this, you may set me down for a ninny.”</p>

<p>“I think we had better get out of the scrape before
we say much about punishing them. I am inclined to
believe that big fellow will suffer from a sore head
for a few weeks to come. I cracked him hard with
this boat-hook.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps this sore head will enable us to find out
who he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>“I hope so; but these fellows have been pretty
cunning. I heard one of them say they had been on
the watch for you several weeks.”</p>

<p>“I was a fool to come ashore here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you were, unless you suspected
something of this kind.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t the remotest suspicion of anything. I
don’t know of any reason why they should wish to
treat me in this manner. I haven’t done anything to
them.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know who they are.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t done anything to any fellows.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that, Waddie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember anything.”</p>

<p>“You don’t?” And it seemed very strange to me
that he had forgotten the facts related to me by Dick
Bayard.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. Do you think I would lie about it?”
retorted he, in a tone and manner which seemed quite
natural to me.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you and some one else cowhide one of the
town fellows some time ago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, that was four or five weeks ago. It couldn’t
have anything to do with that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may. These fellows say they have
been on the lookout for you for weeks.”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten about that,” said he, looking meditative,
and, I thought, chagrined. “But those fellows
insulted me, especially a young cub, who threatened
to thrash me. I gave him a dose the next day, which
I think he will remember when he wants to be impudent
to me.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so! And I am only surprised that you
did not remember it yourself when you were tied to
that tree with the tar-kettle before you.”</p>

<p>“Do you really believe that fellow is at the bottom
of this affair?” asked Waddie, knitting his brows.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“But that fellow was smaller than any of these.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I can give you no information, for I
don’t know any of them. But we will talk over that
matter another time. You stay where you are,
Waddie, and I will take an observation.”</p>

<p>I crept for some distance through the cow-path in
the underbrush, till I heard voices near the lake. I<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
could not see the ruffians, but I judged by the sound
that they were moving toward the wharf where
Waddie’s boat was moored. I proceeded still farther
toward the lake, and, emerging from the bushes, I
discovered all four of the wretches on the wharf.
The two whom I had imprisoned in the cabin of the
<em>Belle</em> had broken out, as I had anticipated, or, possibly,
the other two had released them. I feared that they
had ruined, or badly damaged, my boat, and I was
very anxious about her.</p>

<p>I hastened back to the spot where I had left Waddie,
and conducted him to a position near the open woods.
I did not think it expedient to exhibit ourselves yet,
and we waited an hour or more in our concealment.
I could not see Waddie’s persecutors. They did not
attempt any further pursuit. Probably they supposed
we had started on foot for Centreport, and, doubtless,
they deemed it proper to consider what steps were
necessary to insure their own safety, for they knew
very well that Colonel Wimpleton would turn out
the whole town in pursuit of them as soon as he heard
of the attempted outrage.</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon!” exclaimed Waddie, who<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
was becoming very impatient after an hour’s anxious
waiting, “there they are, going off in my boat!”</p>

<p>“Good!” I replied. “They couldn’t do anything
that would suit me better; that is, if they have not
sunk or smashed the <em>Belle</em>.”</p>

<p>This thought gave me a severe pang, and I almost
groaned as I thought of my beautiful craft ruined
by these malignant wretches.</p>

<p>“No matter if they have, Wolf. My father will
pay for making her as good as ever she was,” said
Waddie.</p>

<p>“But I am engaged to go up the lake in her with a
party on Monday morning.”</p>

<p>“We will pay all damages, so that you shall not
lose a penny. But I’ll bet you won’t want to go
up the lake next week in the <em>Belle</em>,” he added warmly.</p>

<p>I did not care to follow up the significance of this
remark, for I had not much confidence in the fair-weather
promises of the Wimpletons. I judged that
he intended to do some great thing for me. Perhaps
he only flattered himself that he meant to be magnanimous
and generous. He was as impulsive in his loves
as in his hates; and, though he adhered to the latter<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
with extraordinary tenacity, the former cooled off very
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose those fellows know how to handle
a boat?” I continued, as I saw Waddie’s sloop go out
into the lake under full sail.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” replied he, with energy. “But I
wish they were in your boat, instead of mine, for
then they would go to the bottom if they upset her.”</p>

<p>“I hope they won’t be drowned,” I added, as the
boat heeled over so that her gunwale went under.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if they are.”</p>

<p>“Be reasonable, Waddie.”</p>

<p>“I am reasonable. What do you suppose I care
for the villains, after what they have done to me?”</p>

<p>“Love your enemies, Waddie. Return good for
evil.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to talk; but I don’t believe much
in that sort of stuff.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t stuff, Waddie. If I had acted on your
principle, you would have been tarred and feathered
before this time.”</p>

<p>“You won’t lose anything by what you have done,
Wolf,” replied he rather sheepishly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t expect to make anything by it.”</p>

<p>“You will.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the idea. If I had acted on your plan,
I should have taken hold and helped those fellows
impose upon you. I don’t ask or expect anything for
what I have done. I have made enemies of these
chaps, whoever they are, for the sake of one who
drove me out of Centreport, hit me a crack in the
face the other day, and told me squarely that he hated
me.”</p>

<p>“You wait, Wolf, and see what you will see.”</p>

<p>“I don’t ask anything, and I won’t take anything
for what I have done. I only want you to have ideas
a little different about other people.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use of talking; you may be a saint, but I
can’t be one,” said Waddie impatiently. “I think
those fellows will swamp the boat; but she has air-tanks,
and can’t sink.”</p>

<p>“We needn’t stay here any longer. You can go up-town
in my boat. I think we may as well be ready to
pick those fellows up when they upset.”</p>

<p>“I will try to find my clothes,” said Waddie, as he
moved off toward the tar-kettle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>I went down to my boat. She lay just as I had left
her, except that the two glass ports in the trunk of the
cabin were broken. The prisoners had evidently attempted
to reach the lock by thrusting their arms
through these apertures. Whether they succeeded or
not, or whether they were released by their companions
outside, I do not know. Beyond the breaking of
the glass, no injury had been done to the <em>Belle</em>. The
padlock and key were both there. I hoisted my reefed
mainsail, and stood up to the wharf, toward which
Waddie was now walking, with his coat and vest on
his arm.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE WRECK OF THE “HIGHFLYER.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When I ran the <em>Belle</em> out of the little inlet in which
I had moored her I found that the wind had been
increasing, and the waves were really quite savage.
My first solicitude was in regard to the ruffians in
Waddie’s boat; for, whatever they deserved in the
way of punishment, it was terrible to think of their
being engulfed in the raging waters. I soon obtained
a view of them. They had lowered the sail, and
were tossing madly about on the waves. Of course,
the craft was no longer under control, if it had been
since the rogues embarked in her, and she appeared to
be drifting rapidly toward the land.</p>

<p>The line of the shore in this part of the lake extended
about northwest and southeast. Without
knowing anything at all about a boat, the conspirators
against the peace and dignity of Waddie Wimpleton
had run out from the wharf, keeping the wind on the
beam. Doubtless, the furious movements of the boat<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
astonished them. It must have shaken them up to a
degree they had never before experienced; but they
were reckless fellows, and perhaps believed that this
was the ordinary behavior of a boat when the breeze
was fresh.</p>

<p>They were not far from right in this respect; but
they ought to have known that a boat needs skilful
handling at such a time. They had continued on their
course about half-way across the lake. They did not
seem to know enough to ease off the sheet when the
heavy flaws came, or to “touch her up” with the
helm. When it came so heavy that they could stand
it no longer, they lowered the sail. A boat without
any sail on, even in a blow, is as bad as an unruly
horse without a bridle. She must have steerageway,
or she cannot be controlled. She was now in the
trough of the sea, rolling helplessly in the billows&mdash;now
dipping in the water on one side, and now on
the other.</p>

<p>When I ran in at the pier Waddie jumped on
board of the <em>Belle</em>. He had put on his coat and vest,
but still complained that he was very cold. I had
some old coats in my cabin, which I offered to him,<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
and, though they were not fashionable garments, he
was glad to avail himself of my wardrobe.</p>

<p>“It blows heavier than ever, Waddie,” I said, while
he was putting on one of the ragged and weather-stained
overcoats.</p>

<p>“If you can’t run up to town, I can go on shore and
walk up,” he replied, glancing at the angry lake.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can go it, well enough; but I was thinking
of those fellows out there.”</p>

<p>“I shall not waste much fine feeling upon them, you
had better believe!”</p>

<p>“They have lowered the sail, and are rolling about
there like mud-turtles on a log. The boat must be
full of water.”</p>

<p>“She will not sink, and as long as they hold on
they will be safe enough.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that, Waddie. They are drifting
like mad toward the rocky point above Gulfport.
If they run your boat on those sharp rocks, it will be
all day with them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for the boat.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want her smashed&mdash;do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care if she is. She has been beaten, and,
if she should be smashed, my father would order another.”</p>

<p>I did not care so much about the boat as I did about
the fellows in her. I did not wish to have even one
of them drowned before my eyes. I put on my coat,
and then pushed off from the wharf. In a few moments
we were in the thickest of it, and even the <em>Belle</em>
curtsied so low as to take in the “drink” over her
lee rail. But I eased her off so that she went along
very well, as any boat will when properly handled.</p>

<p>“They are hoisting sail,” said Waddie.</p>

<p>“So much the worse for them,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Have they reefed her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they know enough to do that.”</p>

<p>“They have! What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I am going to keep near enough to them to pull
them out of the water if they get overboard.”</p>

<p>“They are running right before the wind, toward
the Gulfport point. I think they have had sailing
enough for one day. Let her out a little, Wolf; perhaps
we can ascertain who they are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>“I think not. They will keep their faces covered
up while you are around; for being found out would
be almost as bad as being drowned to them.”</p>

<p>The ruffians, probably seeing the sail on the <em>Belle</em>
reefed, found that they could do a similar thing with
their own canvas. They had fastened the reef-points
in some manner, and were running before the gale toward
the rocky point. I did not understand what
they intended to do; but it did not occur to me that
they would be stupid enough to attempt a landing on
a lee shore in such a sea as raged at the time. If
they had any common sense, it ought to have taught
them better.</p>

<p>I let out the sheet, and gave chase. The <em>Belle</em>
leaped like a race-horse over the waves, tossing the
spray in bucketfuls over Waddie and myself. I
hoped to overhaul the <em>Highflyer</em> in season to warn the
ruffians of their danger. But they were half a mile
to leeward of me when the chase commenced, for I
did not think of pursuing them till they began to hoist
the sail. I thought it would be time enough to help
them when they called for assistance, as I was not<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
quite sure they would not still subject my companion
to further indignities if they could catch him on shore.</p>

<p>I was gaining rapidly on the <em>Highflyer</em>, under her
clumsy management, and if there had been half a mile
farther to run I should have come up with her. The
rascals in charge of her appeared to be profiting by
their experience. They were daring fellows, as their
intentions toward Waddie at the grove fully demonstrated,
and they did not exhibit any signs of fear,
though I could well believe they were not a little
anxious about the future. Probably they had discovered
that the <em>Highflyer</em> was a life-boat, for her
copper air-tanks were in plain sight in her forward
cuddy. To my mind it was a pity that such bold
fellows should be such consummate rascals, for so I
must call any persons who would tar and feather a
boy, under any circumstances.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they mean to do, Wolf?”
asked Waddie, beginning to be much excited by the
situation.</p>

<p>“I think they intended to go up to Centreport in
your boat, but found they could not go against the
wind. They didn’t know how to beat her up. I<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
believe they intend to get ashore now as quick as they
can.”</p>

<p>“Do they mean to land on those rocks ahead of
them?”</p>

<p>“I should judge that they did. They are not far
from them, either,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I may as well say good-by to the <em>Highflyer</em>, then.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if you might say good-by to
some of those fellows, also,” I added, very anxious for
the result.</p>

<p>Waddie said no more, and I did not then. Both of
us were bracing our nerves for the catastrophe, which
could not be postponed many minutes longer.</p>

<p>“Boat, ahoy!” I shouted, with all the voice I could
command.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” replied the gruff-toned fellow,
who, in the boat as on the shore, was the leading
spirit.</p>

<p>“Keep off the shore, or you will all be drowned!” I
shouted.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” answered back the chief conspirator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>This reply, being interpreted, evidently signified that
the speaker did not mean to be caught or run down,
or in any other way vanquished by his pursuer.</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon!” exclaimed Waddie,
clinging to the side of the boat, “she is in for it!”</p>

<p>“Keep off!” I shouted furiously; and by this time
the <em>Belle</em> was within five rods of the <em>Highflyer</em>.</p>

<p>“Keep off yourself!” responded the gruff-toned
fellow; and I noticed they had all covered their faces
again.</p>

<p>“You will lose your lives if you don’t keep off!” I
added, with all the energy I could throw into the
words.</p>

<p>I found it necessary, at this exciting point of the
chase, to sheer off myself, lest a treacherous rock
should knock a hole in the <em>Belle</em>. At the same instant
the <em>Highflyer</em> rose on a wave, and then went
down on the sharp rocks, with so much force that her
bottom must have been completely stove in. I heard
the crash, and held my breath with anxiety for the
fate of the boys on board. They dropped down into
the water, which I could now see rose within her
nearly to the gunwales, and held on for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>The receding wave carried the wreck back, and another
lifted it up and jammed it down upon the jagged
rocks with tremendous force. It was built of light
material, and could not resist such a pounding for a
single instant. Her mast went by the board, and
she actually broke into pieces. The next wave that
swept over her forced two of the four boys out of
her, and pitched them into the water while the other
two held on to the fragments.</p>

<p>“That’s rough!” gasped Waddie.</p>

<p>“I hope they will get out of it; but we can’t do
anything for them,” I replied, with my heart in my
throat.</p>

<p>I saw the two fellows who had been pitched out of
the boat making their way over the rocks to the dry
land. One of them limped, as though he had been
severely injured. By this time all of them had lost
their masks, or uncovered their faces; but they were
too far from me to be identified. The <em>Belle</em> was now
standing away from the scene of the thrilling event
close-hauled; but we watched the two boys on the
wreck, still fearful that the fierce waves might swallow
them up. The billows continued to drive the fragments<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
nearer to the shore, till we saw the boys rush
through the water and make their escape.</p>

<p>“That is the end of the <em>Highflyer</em>,” said Waddie.
I was thankful that it was not also the end of her late
crew.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BY THE GREAT HORN SPOON!</span></h2>
</div>


<p>By this time the wind had increased to a tempest,
and never before had I seen such waves and such
spray on Lake Ucayga. I should not have been willing
to believe that any sea that ever raged on our
beautiful sheet of water could make such a complete
wreck of a boat, even with the aid of the rocks, as
that we had just witnessed. The <em>Highflyer</em> was as
thoroughly broken up as though the work had been
accomplished with axes and hammers, and the pieces
were driven far up on the rocky shore.</p>

<p>The persecutors of Waddie had escaped; but they
had probably been as effectually frightened as any
four boys ever were before; and they were not likely
to go into the business of navigation again on their
own account very soon. They deserved a severe punishment;
but, on the whole, I was rather glad that
we had not been able to identify them, for the vengeance
of Waddie and his father was also so disproportionate<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
to the offense that, in the present instance,
nothing less than absolute ruin of the ruffians, and
even of their families and friends, would appease the
wrath of the injured magnate and his son.</p>

<p>The <em>Belle</em> behaved remarkably well. I was aware
of her stiff and stanch character before I bought her;
but she more than realized my expectations. She
was as buoyant as a feather, and lifted her head to
the seas as gracefully as though the tempest was her
natural element. She took in torrents of spray, but
she did not ship any water. Her mast bent like a
reed in the blast, and, of course, I had to favor her
when the heavy gusts struck her. Both Waddie and
myself were wet to the skin, and both of us were
shivering with the cold. It was not exactly pleasant,
therefore, however exciting it was.</p>

<p>I ran the <em>Belle</em> out into the lake, and then, at a
single stretch, made the pier at the picnic grove, the
point from which we had started before. I was afraid
I should lose my mast, and I was not disposed to
cripple the boat merely to see what she could do. Behind
the pier we had tolerably smooth water, and I
decided to put another reef in the mainsail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“What are you going to do now, Wolf?” asked
Waddie, his teeth chattering as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m going to put in one more reef, for I don’t
like to risk my mast,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Are you going to try to run down in the teeth
of this blow?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I must get home myself, and get the boat home.”</p>

<p>“I thought you ran in here to wait for better
weather.”</p>

<p>“No; only to put in another reef.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know that I can quite stand this. I
am not afraid of anything, but I am half-frozen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll warm you very soon, and you may go home
as comfortably as though you were in the cabin of the
<em>Ucayga</em>,” I replied. “We are in no particular hurry,
but I don’t think we shall see any better weather to-day.”</p>

<p>I went into the cabin, and lighted the fire in the
little stove, which was filled with kindling-wood, ready
for the match. I rigged the little copper funnel on
the forward deck, and in that wind the draft was
so strong that the fire roared merrily in a few moments.
Having secured the mainsail, I joined Waddie<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
in the cabin, closing the doors behind me. In less
than half an hour we had a temperature of at least
ninety degrees, and both of us were thawed out. We
took off our coats, and placed them near the stove.
We were as warm as toast, and though I did not announce
the fact, I believed that the <em>Belle</em> was a great
institution.</p>

<p>“I had something to eat on board of the <em>Highflyer</em>,”
said Waddie; “but my dinner has gone to destruction
with the boat.”</p>

<p>“I have some provisions on board, such as they are;
but I suppose they will not suit one who sits at your
father’s table.”</p>

<p>“Anything will suit me, Wolf. I am not dainty
when I’m hungry; and I am as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m as hungry as a wolf.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are!” laughed Waddie, who appeared
to be conscious that I had made a pun, though
I did not regard it as a very savage one.</p>

<p>I took from the locker under the berth on which
I sat a basket of “provender,” which my mother had
put up for me. For common sort of people, I thought<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
we lived very well, and I was not ashamed to produce
the contents of my basket, even in the presence of the
little magnate of Centreport. I had some slices of
cold ham, some bread and butter, and an apple-pie. If
the crust of the latter was a little coarse and dark-colored,
it was still tender and healthful. I lowered
the table and arranged the food upon it, using the
dishes which constituted a portion of the boat’s furniture.</p>

<p>Waddie did me the honor to say that my dinner
was quite as good, if not better, than that which he
had lost in the <em>Highflyer</em>, and he soon proved his
sincerity by eating a quantity which rather astonished
me, liberal feeder as I was. I am sure I relished the
meal all the more because he enjoyed it so much. I
should have added hot coffee to the feast, only we
had no milk, and both of us agreed that coffee would
not be coffee without this important addition.</p>

<p>The dinner was finished. I cleared away the dishes
and restored the cabin to its usual order. By this
time we were quite dry, for an atmosphere of from
ninety to a hundred makes sharp warfare upon moist
garments. The heat was beginning to be oppressive<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
to me, and I opened the slide a little way, to admit
the fresh air so abundant that day on the lake. I
took my coat and resumed my seat on the berth, for
the cabin was not high enough to permit a standing-posture.
Waddie sat opposite to me. He had been
in deep thought for some minutes, while I was making
my preparations to breast the storm again.</p>

<p>I had put on my coat, and was buttoning it close
around my throat, to keep out the cold and the water,
when my companion startled me by a demonstration
as strange in him as it would have been in the Emperor
Napoleon, if I had been admitted to the sacred
precincts of the Tuileries. Suddenly he sprang forward
and reached out his right hand to me across
the table. I looked at it in bewildered astonishment,
and with a suspicion that Waddie had suddenly become
insane.</p>

<p>“Will you take my hand, Wolf?” said he, in the
mildest of tones.</p>

<p>“Certainly I will, if you desire it;” and I clasped
the offered member.</p>

<p>“Wolf, I have been your enemy,” said he, still
retaining my hand. “I have hated you; I have used<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
you meanly; I have despised you. Will you forgive
me?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, Waddie,” I replied, pressing his
hand. “I never laid up anything against you.”</p>

<p>“Are we friends?” he asked earnestly.</p>

<p>“We are.”</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon, Wolf, I shall stick to
you now like a brother! Oh, I’m in earnest, Wolf.
You needn’t smile at it!”</p>

<p>“I think you are sincere.”</p>

<p>“I know I am. It is not altogether because you got
me out of a bad scrape to-day that I say all this, but
because you behaved so handsomely after all my
meanness toward you. I don’t understand it yet,
Wolf. I don’t see how you could do it; but I know
it is so, and that’s enough for me. I wish I could
be like you.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will be better than I am,” I modestly
replied.</p>

<p>“I don’t ask to be any better than you are. All
the fellows like you&mdash;I mean all the decent fellows.
My father is rich, and yours is poor; but that don’t
seem to make any difference. The fellows on the<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
other side would have mobbed Tommy Toppleton for
your sake if he hadn’t broken his leg. I don’t see
why they should like you so much better than Tommy.
Our fellows don’t seem to like me much better, though
I don’t see why they shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we will talk that over another time,” I
answered, not deeming it prudent to be entirely candid
with him.</p>

<p>“I’m going to stick to you, Wolf, till the end of
time, and I’m going to take your advice, too, if you
will give it to me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that my advice will be worth much;
but if I can be of any service to you, Waddie, I shall
be very glad. I think we must get under way now.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. Stay in the cabin and make yourself
as comfortable as possible. I can handle the <em>Belle</em>
without any assistance.”</p>

<p>“But I want to talk with you some more.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall have time enough when we get
down to Centreport.”</p>

<p>“I feel as though you had been the best friend I<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
ever had in the world, and, by the great horn spoon! I
am going to be such a friend as you never had before.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t make any rash promises, Waddie,” I
answered, smiling at his enthusiasm. “You had better
sleep on it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to sleep on it. I have been your
enemy, but now I am your friend. If it hadn’t been
for me, you would have been running the <em>Ucayga</em> to-day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t find any fault, though such a berth as that
would have suited me first-rate,” I continued, laughing;
but I confess I had but little confidence in my
new-made friend’s zeal in my favor.</p>

<p>“It is not too late, Wolf, for my father and I are
disgusted with the management of the boat, and it is
high time something should be done.”</p>

<p>“We will talk it over by and by,” I added, leaving
the cabin.</p>

<p>I put another reef into the mainsail, cast off the
painter, which I had made fast to the pier, and pushed
off. In a moment the <em>Belle</em> was rolling and pitching<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
in the heavy surges of the lake. With two reefs in
her mainsail she would not lie very close to the wind;
but I ran her across the lake, intending to work along
under the lee of the west shore, partially sheltered by
the high bank from the fury of the tempest.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WADDIE IN A NEW CHARACTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Even as close-hauled as she could be under the
double-reefed mainsail, the <em>Belle</em> flew on her course;
but under this short sail she did not labor so heavily
as before, and I had no fear but that she would
make tolerably good weather of it. As I had anticipated,
I found comparatively smooth water under the
lee of the west shore; but, with two reefs in the mainsail,
I found it impossible to lie close enough to the
wind to avoid running out into the heavy sea.</p>

<p>I decided to make a sheltered cove, and turn out the
last reef I had put in, satisfied that I could keep close
enough under this sail to avoid the savage sea in the
middle of the lake. Waddie was reclining upon one
of the berths, as comfortable as though he had been
in his father’s house, while I was again shivering with
the cold and wet to the skin. I supposed he was working
up his good resolutions. I never had much hope
of Waddie, his temper was so bad and his impulses<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
so violent. On the other hand, it had always seemed
to me that a very little improvement would make a
good fellow of Tommy Toppleton. It was, therefore,
almost incredible that the former should be the first
to proclaim his good resolutions, and express a desire
to mend his character.</p>

<p>Waddie’s impulses, whether good or evil, appeared
to be equally violent. It is true I had never before
heard him whisper a doubt that he was not, even
morally, the best young man in the vicinity; but his
demonstration seemed to be rather too enthusiastic to
endure for more than a day or two, or a week at the
most. Tommy Toppleton had never, I confidently believe,
soared to the elevation of making good resolutions.
If he had, there would have been hope of
him.</p>

<p>My companion in the boat was engaged in deep
and earnest thought. I should not have known any
better what he was thinking about if he had told me
in so many words. In the face of his earnestness,
therefore, I could not help cherishing a slight hope
that he would do better&mdash;it was not a strong hope.
I determined to encourage him as much as I could,<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
and in a gentle way make such suggestions to him
from time to time as his case seemed to require.</p>

<p>After all, it was not so surprising that Waddie
should have his eyes opened by the exciting events
of that day. He had been thoroughly convinced that
he was not omnipotent; that there was such a thing
as retribution. Probably he was also aware of the
extent of the dislike with which the Wimpletonians regarded
him. He was no fool, and ordinary perception
would have enabled him to comprehend his relations
with his associates at the institute. I think he ought
to have known all that Dick Bayard had told me;
and possibly he was suspicious that his battalion and
the stockholders of his steamboat company intended
to mutiny against him. At any rate, he was conscious
of his own unpopularity; he had acknowledged
as much to me. He was in deep thought. I did not
disturb him.</p>

<p>I turned out the reef, and Waddie still devoted
himself to his meditations. The <em>Belle</em> filled away
again, and in the shelter of the shore went along quite
easily. The change in the motion of the boat seemed<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
to attract the attention of my passenger, and he
opened the slide, to see what was going on.</p>

<p>“The wind has gone down, hasn’t it, Wolf?” said
he.</p>

<p>“No; the sea is just as heavy out in the middle of
the lake as ever. We are under the lee of the shore
now.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be quite comfortable. I think I will
come out, for I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>“It is pretty dry now. You will find some more
old coats under the port berth.”</p>

<p>Waddie presently came out of the cabin, enveloped
in an old overcoat which my father had worn out.
He appeared to have something on his mind, of which
he was anxious to discharge himself. He took a seat
by my side; but, though the <em>Belle</em> was going along
tolerably well for such a day, he did not speak for
some time. Aware of his impulsive nature, I rather
expected to be appointed engineer or captain of the
<em>Ucayga</em>; for, as I have said before, he was the president
of the steamboat company, though his movements
were more effectually controlled than his rival
on the other side of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>“Wolf, I know you don’t like me very well,” said
he, at last, and with something like a troubled look on
his face.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say that your conduct toward me
has been such as to make me love you very much. I
won’t be a hypocrite, Waddie,” I replied.</p>

<p>“But what made you interfere when those fellows
were abusing me?” he asked, looking me full in the
face. “If you don’t like me, why did you risk a
broken head to save me? That’s what I want to
know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can explain my conduct very
well,” I answered, laughing. “I have always tried to
think kindly of those who wanted to injure me. I
thought that those fellows were doing an abominably
mean and wicked thing, and that it was my duty to
interfere. That’s really all I know about it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it. I was in hopes that, after
all I have done and said, you really did like me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t dislike you.”</p>

<p>“No matter; of course, I can’t blame you for not
liking me; but I want to begin anew. When I gave
you my hand, and wanted to be friends, I was in real<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
earnest. I want you to be my friend, and stand by
me.”</p>

<p>“Stand by you!” I exclaimed. “I can’t stand by
you unless you are in the right. I wouldn’t stand by
you after you, with another, had caught a small boy
and licked him.”</p>

<p>Waddie bit his lips, and I thought he was going to
get mad, for what I had said was a home-thrust.</p>

<p>“I was wrong in that, Wolf,” said he, with a
struggle, which was creditable to him, and which
raised him very much in my estimation.</p>

<p>“You were, indeed; and that scrape was the father
of the one you got into to-day.”</p>

<p>“I know it; and I am afraid there are other scrapes
in store for me. The institute fellows and the members
of our battalion are down upon me; so is the
steamboat company.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to tell you just what I think,
Waddie?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“Even if it is not pleasant?”</p>

<p>“Yes; say on.”</p>

<p>“If I were in your place, Waddie, I would be the<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
most popular fellow in the whole region round about
us. I would have every fellow like me, and stand by
me,” I continued earnestly, as the boat approached the
Narrows.</p>

<p>“Well, I have tried to be.”</p>

<p>“Have you, indeed!” I replied, laughing in spite of
myself at the absurdity of the proposition, though it
is very likely Waddie believed what he said, strange
as it may seem.</p>

<p>“I have been president of the steamboat company,
major of the battalion; and I don’t see why the fellows
don’t like me.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you candidly why they do not. Because
you think more of yourself than you do of any
other fellow. You are selfish and exacting. You
think every fellow ought to yield to you; and you
are tyrannical and overbearing toward them. That’s
what’s the matter, though I shouldn’t have said so if
you had not told me to do it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I am so bad as that?” said he, looking
moody and solemn, rather than angry, as I supposed
he would be.</p>

<p>“I have told you just what I think. Look at it for<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
yourself a moment. Go back to the time when you
blowed up that canal-boat. Do you think you treated
the skipper and his daughter just right? Then you
threatened to blow out my brains if I did not do as
you told me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say any more about that. I am willing to
own that I was wrong,” pleaded he.</p>

<p>“Well, come down to a later day. At the auction
you commanded me not to bid on the <em>Belle</em>. You
pitched into me, tooth and nail, because I did bid.
You forbade my going on the <em>Ucayga</em>, just as Tommy
Toppleton ordered me not to ride on his railroad,
though I paid my fare in both instances. I don’t
rake up these things for any other purpose than to
prove what I said. You can’t expect any fellow to
like you if you conduct yourself in such a manner.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Do anything but what you have done. Respect
the wishes and feelings, and especially the rights, of
others, whether they be poor or rich. I happen to
know myself that the institute fellows are down upon
you, and that they don’t mean to stand your domineering
and tyranny much longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>“What are they going to do?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know; only that they mean mutiny,
in general terms. It is just the same on our
side of the lake. The Toppletonians intend to pull
Tommy down from his high places. At the last election
of officers they did elect another president, but
he declined to serve, though he was sorry enough
afterward that he did not stand.”</p>

<p>“You talk plainly, Wolf,” continued Waddie seriously.
“I don’t think I’m quite so hard a fellow as
you make me out to be.”</p>

<p>“I tell you just what I think, and just what others
think.”</p>

<p>“You are my friend now&mdash;are you not, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“I will do everything I can for you; and if you
will do what is right I will stand by you to the end
of time.”</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon, I will do right if I know
how! You shall tell me what to do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to tell you what to do. If you mean
right, you can’t very well go wrong.”</p>

<p>“You will advise me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will, if you wish me to do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“What would you do now if you were in my place?”</p>

<p>The arrival of the <em>Belle</em> at Centreport pier prevented
me from answering this question, though I
kept thinking of it while I was securing the boat to
enable Waddie to go on shore. But he was not willing
to part with me, and insisted so strongly that I
should go up to “his house” with him that I could
not refuse. He clung to me like a brother, and I was
confident that he intended then to mend his manners,
whether he held out in the resolution or not. I lowered
my sail, and walked up the street with him.</p>

<p>I went to his house, and the visit was productive
of the most important results.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A STEAMBOAT STRIKE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>While I was walking with Waddie from the pier
to his father’s house, I deemed it necessary to ask
myself whether or not I was “toadying” to the son
of the rich man of Centreport. I should have despised
myself if I had believed such was the case. Both
my father and myself were determined to be independent,
in the true sense of the word. We had discussed
the meaning of the word, and reached the
conclusion that genuine independence was not impudence,
a desire to provoke a quarrel, or anything of
that kind. We agreed that the term was often misunderstood
and abused.</p>

<p>But true independence was a genuine self-respect,
which would not allow its possessor to cringe before
the mighty, or to sacrifice honor and integrity for the
sake of money or position. Doubtless both of us had
been guilty, to some extent, of this subserviency; but
we were determined not to fall below our standard<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
again. Colonel Wimpleton and Major Toppleton had
money and influence; but we had skill and labor.
We could do without them quite as well as they could
do without us. Avoiding all conspiracies, all impudence,
and all intentions to quarrel, we meant to maintain
our own self-respect. If neither of the great
men wanted us, we could go elsewhere, and “paddle
our own canoe” to our own satisfaction.</p>

<p>I may say that my father and I had made a kind
of compact of this nature; and when I found myself,
to my great astonishment, and almost to my chagrin,
to be hand and glove with Waddie, I began to suspect
that I had been sacrificing myself to the mammon
of influence. But a little reflection assured me I was
not guilty of the charge. I had saved my new friend
from a disgraceful and humiliating ordeal only from
a sense of duty, and not with the intention of “currying
favor” with him. I had told him, fairly and
squarely, what I thought of him, and what others
thought of him. As I considered what I had said to
him I found no occasion to reproach myself. On the
contrary, so far as appearances went, I had converted
Waddie from the error of his ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>My companion was gentle and kind to me. He
acted like an altered person&mdash;using no harsh or bullying
language and appearing to be only anxious to
ascertain what was right, in order that he might do it.
I followed him into his father’s library, where a cheerful
fire blazed in the grate, and we seated ourselves
before it. I had hardly ever been in this room before,
though I had frequently visited the major’s library.</p>

<p>“Wolf, just as the <em>Belle</em> came up to the pier I
asked what you would do if you were in my place,”
said Waddie, after we had comfortably disposed ourselves
in the cushioned armchairs. “You did not answer
me.”</p>

<p>“You ask me hard questions, Waddie,” I replied,
laughing. “I do know what I should do if I were
in your place, but I do not like to set myself up as
your adviser.”</p>

<p>“I ask you to do it. I will thank you for it.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you what I think, and then you can do
as you like. I can give you advice; but you are not
obliged to follow it, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you be so afraid to speak, Wolf!” added
Waddie rather impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, then, in the first place, I should make my
peace with all the fellows, whether in the institute
or not.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do that; but the thing of it is, how
to do it.”</p>

<p>“You have been riding a high horse. You are
major, president, and I don’t know what not. You
have used those positions to tyrannize over and bully
even your best friends.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said he, as I paused to note the effect of
these words upon him.</p>

<p>“You must put yourself in a humble position, to
begin with.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” exclaimed he, with enthusiasm. “I’ll
do anything you say, if it is to go down on my knees
before the ragged little rowdies in the streets of Centreport.”</p>

<p>“I shall not advise you to do anything of that kind;
but, under the circumstances, I should resign the positions
of major and president.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>“Resign them!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I would show the fellows first that I am
as willing to obey as I am to command. The fellows
mean mutiny, both in the steamboat company and in
the battalion.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it. What next?” he asked, rubbing his
hands, in humble imitation of his magnificent father,
when he was pleased.</p>

<p>“I should take my place in the battalion as a private,
do my duty faithfully, and obey my officers in
every respect. As a stockholder in the company, I
should behave modestly, and not attempt to carry my
points by bullying, or any other unfair practises. In
any and every capacity, if I had an opportunity to do
a kindness to either friend or enemy, I should do it,
even at some considerable personal sacrifice. But I
don’t wish to burden you with my opinions.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would tell me to go to the Sunday-school,
or something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“I certainly recommend that; but I was speaking
only of your relations with the boys in the vicinity.
If you have a good heart, you will do your duty.”</p>

<p>“There will be a meeting of the steamboat company<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
next week. I will have my resignation ready.
Oh, I am in earnest,” protested Waddie.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better consult your father. I
don’t want you to act blindly on my advice. He may
not think it best for you to do as I say.”</p>

<p>“I know he won’t; and for that reason I shall not
say anything to him. I’m not going to say anything
against my father; but I know what’s what.”</p>

<p>“But you may endanger his interests in the
steamer,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“No; the directors can’t do anything without his
approval. There is no danger. Besides, my father is
as cross as a bear lately. The railroad on the other
side is beating us every day. He has been quarreling
with the captain and engineer for a week.”</p>

<p>“Is it their fault that the boat is beaten?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Father thinks it is, in part. The engineer won’t
drive the boat, and the captain is a slow coach.”</p>

<p>Waddie had scarcely made his explanation before
the library door opened, and Colonel Wimpleton bolted
into the room. He appeared to be much excited,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
threw down his hat, and seemed to be disposed to
smash things. He did not see me at first; but when
he discovered my presence he came up to me, and, to
my great astonishment, offered me his hand. He
glanced curiously at Waddie, as he realized the fact
that his son was on good terms with me.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you, Wolf,” said he, as he grasped
my hand. “I suppose you thought I had forgotten
you; but I have not. A Wimpleton never forgets a
friendly act, nor forgives a malicious one. What’s
up, Waddie?” he continued, as he turned to his son.</p>

<p>“Wolf and I are the best friends in the world,
father,” replied Waddie. “Ain’t we, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, just now; and I hope it will always
continue,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, it will!” persisted Waddie.</p>

<p>“It’s rather odd, to say the least,” added the colonel,
with an incredulous stare at both of us.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how it happened,” said Waddie.</p>

<p>And he related the history of the events of the
morning, and gave me all the credit, and rather more,
I thought, than I deserved.</p>

<p>“That was handsome of you, Wolf, after all that<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
has happened. But who were these rascals? I will
make an end of them!”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know who they were; and we couldn’t
find out.”</p>

<p>“I shall find out!”</p>

<p>Perhaps he would; but at that moment the captain
and engineer of the <em>Ucayga</em> were announced, and the
colonel began to look as savage as when he entered
the room. The servant was told to admit them.</p>

<p>“The villains!” gasped the great man. “They were
half an hour behind time this morning, though they
did not wait for the up-lake boats.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they were not to blame, father,” suggested
Waddie mildly.</p>

<p>“Not to blame! Do you think I don’t know?”</p>

<p>The two men entered the library, hat in hand. They
were brothers, which, perhaps, is the only explanation
which can be offered of the fact that they adhered
to each other in the present difficulty.</p>

<p>“Colonel Wimpleton, we came up to say that we
have concluded not to run in the <em>Ucayga</em> any longer,”
said the captain, with considerable deference, though<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
there was a kind of dogged firmness in his tones and
in his looks.</p>

<p>“Well, sir!” snapped the colonel.</p>

<p>“We have done our best, but we can’t please you.”</p>

<p>“You can’t please me by being half an hour behind
time every day.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my fault,” protested the captain. “And I
won’t be insulted, as I have been to-day before all my
passengers. You may get a new captain and a new
engineer as soon as you please.”</p>

<p>“None of your impudence!”</p>

<p>“My impudence is no worse than yours. You won’t
find any men who can do better than we have.”</p>

<p>“If I can’t, I will sink the boat in the middle of
the lake.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to talk; our time is out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean to run the trip this afternoon?”
demanded the colonel, whose face suddenly flushed, as
he saw the trick of his employees.</p>

<p>“No, sir! We do not,” replied the captain, a gleam
of satisfaction on his face, as he realized that he was
punishing the great man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t say a word, father. Let them go,” whispered
Waddie.</p>

<p>“You will find that we are not slaves,” added the
captain.</p>

<p>Colonel Wimpleton looked at his watch. It wanted
only half an hour of the advertised time to start the
boat for Ucayga. He looked at Waddie, looked at
me, and then at the two men, who doubtless expected,
by the means they had chosen, to bring him
down from “the high horse.” I watched the great
man with intense interest; and perhaps I was as much
excited as any person in the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CAPTAIN WOLF PENNIMAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>My impression now is that neither the captain nor
the engineer really intended to throw up his situation.
While I could not, and did not, blame them for refusing
to submit to the savage abuse of Colonel Wimpleton,
I did not think it was quite fair to spring this
trap upon their employer within thirty minutes of the
time the boat was to start. But the colonel was not
altogether unreasonable in his complaints. The men
did not use every exertion to be on time. There was
fault on both sides.</p>

<p>The captain had been instructed not to lose his connection,
even if he always went without the up-lake
passengers. On this day, as I learned, he had failed
to connect, though he had not waited for the Hitaca
boat. Passengers were dissatisfied, and the new
steamer was rapidly losing the favor of the traveling
public.</p>

<p>Colonel Wimpleton, as he stood before the fire in<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
his library, realized that these men were trying to
punish him. The whispered words of Waddie evidently
made their impression upon him. He curbed
his wrath and was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“Let them go, father,” said Waddie.</p>

<p>He did let them go, and gave them an order on his
agent for their wages.</p>

<p>“Will the boat make her trip this afternoon?” asked
the captain, who did not seem to be pleased with the
result of the interview.</p>

<p>“That’s my affair,” replied the colonel.</p>

<p>“We are going on board for our things. We have
steam up, and, if she is not going, my brother will
have the fires raked down.”</p>

<p>“He needn’t trouble himself. You have an order
for your money. Good afternoon.”</p>

<p>The two men took this hint and left.</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon!” shouted Waddie, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” queried the colonel, glancing
at me.</p>

<p>“Wolf, you are the captain of the <em>Ucayga</em> from this
moment!” roared Waddie, slapping me furiously on<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
the back. “This is my last act as president of the
steamboat company! Do you approve it, father?”</p>

<p>“It is what I wanted before. But we have only
half an hour&mdash;less than that,” replied the great man,
looking at his watch again.</p>

<p>“We can make time if we are fifteen minutes late.
Do you accept, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“I do; with many thanks.”</p>

<p>“But the engineer?” said the colonel anxiously.</p>

<p>“Send over for my father with all possible haste.
I will go down and look out for the engine until he
comes,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I will go over myself in your boat, Wolf. In this
breeze I can cross in five minutes,” added Waddie,
seizing his hat and rushing out of the house.</p>

<p>“I will go with you to the steamer, Wolf,” said
Colonel Wimpleton.</p>

<p>All this was so sudden that I had not time to realize
the situation. As I walked down to the wharf with
the magnate of Centreport, I recalled some mysterious
words of Waddie, which seemed now to have a point.
He had told me that I should not care to go up the<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
lake the next week with the fishing-party. Certainly
he could not have known that the event which had
just occurred would open the way for me; but he was
doubtless aware that the moment he said the word the
captain of the <em>Ucayga</em> would be discharged. He knew
that his father was dissatisfied with the management
of the boat, and I suppose, as soon as he had determined
to be my friend, he meant to give me the position.</p>

<p>“Wolf, I have intended this place for you ever
since you used me so well in the yacht,” said the
colonel, as we walked down the street. “Waddie
would not consent. He hated you like a demon. But
you have conquered him, and that is more than I
could ever do.”</p>

<p>I wanted to tell him that good was all-powerful
against evil; but the remark looked egotistical to me,
and I suppressed it.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t expect too much of me,” I replied.</p>

<p>“No; but I expect a good deal of you. Everybody
on the lake knows you, and you are smart. We must
beat that railroad somehow or other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>“I think we can, sir, if we have any kind of fair
play. But Major Toppleton’s boats are always ten or
fifteen minutes behind time.”</p>

<p>“No matter if they are. If you leave at half-past
two, you can always make time, if you don’t waste
your minutes, as our captain often has done. Wolf,
I believe he has been bribed by Toppleton to lose his
connections.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that.”</p>

<p>“He is a Hitaca man, and has no sympathy with
our side of the lake.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the colonel was right. When I looked the
matter over afterward I was satisfied that there was
some ground for the suspicion. We reached the
wharf, and went on board of the <em>Ucayga</em>. We arrived
at just the right time, for both the captain and
the engineer were stirring up ill feeling among the
crew of the boat; and the latter was at work on the
engine, with the evident intention of spoiling the afternoon
trip. Colonel Wimpleton drove them ashore
without indulging in any unnecessary gentleness. I
directed the fireman to fill up the furnaces, and overhauled<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
the machinery. While I was thus engaged my
father arrived. He was conducted to the engine-room
by Waddie.</p>

<p>“Mr. Penniman, allow me to introduce you to Captain
Penniman, master of the steamer <em>Ucayga</em>,” said
the president of the steamboat company, with a degree
of good-nature of which I had never before supposed
him capable.</p>

<p>“Captain Penniman, I am happy to make your acquaintance,”
laughed my father, as he grasped my
hand and gave it a significant pressure. “I think our
family is getting up in the world, for we have now
the honor to boast that we have a steamboat captain
in it.”</p>

<p>“A very great honor, no doubt; but it will depend
somewhat upon the manner in which he discharges
his duties,” I replied, as good-naturedly as either of
my companions. “Father, we are on duty now, and
we must be on time.”</p>

<p>I looked at my watch. It still wanted ten minutes
of half-past two. Waddie had been so fortunate as
to find my father on the wharf, and had not been
delayed a moment in procuring his services. While<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
at work on the engine I had been making a close calculation.
It was necessary to land our passengers on
the wharf at Ucayga by four o’clock, which gave me
an hour and a half to make the distance&mdash;twenty miles&mdash;including
the stay in Ruoara, generally of fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>My predecessor, when he left the wharf in Centreport
at half-past eight in the forenoon, or half-past
two in the afternoon, was pretty sure to miss his connection;
but he had gone over twenty-one miles, while
I intended to save more than a mile, equivalent to five
minutes of time, in the passage. I had thought over
this matter before, and though my appointment had
been sudden, I was not unprepared for my difficult and
delicate task.</p>

<p>“Father, great things are expected of us,” said I, as
Waddie went out of the engine-room, to witness the
arrival of the old <em>Ruoara</em>, which was just then coming
in at the other side of the wharf.</p>

<p>“I trust we shall not disappoint them; but I hope
you know what you are about,” replied he, casting
an anxious glance at me.</p>

<p>“I do, father; I am just as confident as though I<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
had been running this boat for a year. I want you
to run her at the highest speed you can with safety.”</p>

<p>“I will do it. I served my time on a steamer, and
I am at home here.”</p>

<p>“Keep her moving lively; that’s all I want,” I replied,
as I left the engine-room and made my way to
the hurricane-deck.</p>

<p>Colonel Wimpleton had employed a couple of “runners”
properly to set forth to the passengers who
were going through the merits of his new and splendid
steamer. They were duly posted up in the change
which had just been made.</p>

<p>“Take the <em>Ucayga</em>, Captain Wolf Penniman!”
shouted these worthies. “Sure connection! No failure
this time! You have to change three times by
the railroad. The <em>Ucayga</em>, Captain Wolf Penniman,
gentlemen!”</p>

<p>I was rather startled to hear my name thus freely
used; but I was surprised and gratified to see that not
a few of the passengers came on board of the steamer,
though they were told by the railroad runners that
they would be sure to miss the train at Ucayga. I
recognized not a few of those whom I had known on<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
the railroad, persons who had come to the engine to
talk with me, while waiting for the train or the boat.</p>

<p>“All aboard that’s going!” shouted the mate of the
<em>Ucayga</em>.</p>

<p>“Haul in the planks, and cast off the fasts!” I called
to the hands who were in readiness to discharge this
duty.</p>

<p>I confess that my bosom thrilled with strange emotions
as I issued my first order. But I felt quite at
home, for I had run a great deal upon the old boats,
both in the engine-room and on deck. I had witnessed
the operation of making a landing so frequently that
I was sure I could do it without assistance, if necessary.
I had measured the distance, estimated the
force of winds and currents, so many times that I
had thoroughly conquered the problem.</p>

<p>The <em>Ruoara</em> backed out and headed for Middleport
at quarter of three, for the train started at three.
Lewis Holgate still ran the locomotive, and it had
been found that he must start on time or he was sure
to miss his connection.</p>

<p>No regular pilots were employed on any of these
steamers. The mate and deck-hands took the wheel<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
when required, and any of them were able to make
the landing. I told the former to take the wheel, for
I had decided to let him make the landings on this
trip, rather than run even the slightest risks by my
own inexperience. The <em>Ucayga</em> slipped out from the
wharf, and my father, true to his instructions, gave
her full steam.</p>

<p>“We are nearly ten minutes later than usual,” said
Colonel Wimpleton, shaking his head ominously, as
we met on the forward deck.</p>

<p>“I pledge you my word, sir, that the boat shall be
in Ucayga on time,” I replied confidently.</p>

</div>


<p>Colonel Wimpleton was evidently very anxious, as
he had been from the beginning, for the success of
the steamer. On the present occasion, when the
<em>Ucayga</em> was nearly ten minutes behind her ordinary
time, I grant that he had not much to hope for in the
light of past experience; but he did not know my
plans, and I did not wish to startle him by announcing
them, fearful that, if I did so, he would not permit
me to carry them out. I repeated my promise to be
on time, and though he was far from satisfied, he could
not do anything but wait the result.</p>

<p>My calculations were based upon the assured fact
that the <em>Ucayga</em> could easily make sixteen miles an
hour. She had the reputation of being a fast boat,
and I intended that she should sustain her reputation.
Immense expense had been lavished upon her to give
her great speed, as well as to make her elegant and
commodious. The testimony was that she had repeatedly<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
made her sixteen miles without straining or undue
crowding. This was all I asked of her. If she did
only what she was warranted to do, and what she
had often accomplished, I was safe.</p>

<p>I knew every tree and point on the west shore, along
which the railroad extended, and its exact distance
from Middleport. I watched these points, and consulted
my watch frequently, to assure myself that the
boat was not falling behind my calculations. Her
first four miles were made inside of fifteen minutes,
and I was not sure that my father was not overdoing
the matter; but he was a safe man, and I did not think
it necessary even to see him.</p>

<p>On the forward deck I attended to the arrangement
of the baggage, so as to make the stay at Ruoara as
brief as possible. There were two baggage-trucks,
upon which I caused to be loaded all the freight, luggage,
and merchandise for Ruoara. I saw that the
deck-hands were rather disposed to snuff at a boy
like me in command of the steamer; but, in self-defense,
I must add that I was nearly as tall as a man.
They were slow, and did not obey promptly. I
thought I could, in part, explain the failure of my<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
predecessor to be on time. But it was of no use for
me to bluster at these men, though they were probably
working more leisurely than usual.</p>

<p>“Is everything going to suit you?” asked the colonel,
as they were approaching the wharf at Ruoara.</p>

<p>“Not quite, sir.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>“The men work as though they were digging their
own graves, which were to be occupied as soon as
finished.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they mind you?”</p>

<p>“They don’t refuse to mind, but they are slow.
They think I’m only a boy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll discharge every one of them!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir; but don’t do that. I would rather
add a quarter a day to their wages,” I replied; for I
happened to know that they were greatly dissatisfied
with their pay, and justly so, I thought. “Then, if
they don’t work, they shall be discharged.”</p>

<p>“Do so, if you think best,” replied the colonel
promptly.</p>

<p>“And the mate?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>“Give him half a dollar a day, if that will help the
matter.”</p>

<p>“I think they are not paid fair wages, or I would
not have said a word. As it is, I can make friends of
them in this way.”</p>

<p>“Only beat the railroad, and I don’t care what it
costs,” replied the magnate impatiently.</p>

<p>“I will do it, sir.”</p>

<p>The plan was a stroke of policy on my part. As a
boy I could do nothing with these men by bullying and
threatening them. By doing a good thing for them,
I could conquer them easily. I went up to the wheel-house
as the boat neared the wharf.</p>

<p>“Mr. Van Wolter, I will thank you to make this
landing yourself,” said I, addressing the mate, who
had the wheel.</p>

<p>“I think I can do it,” replied he, with a broad grin,
which was as much as to say that I could not do it.</p>

<p>“So can I; but I prefer that you should do it this
time,” I added.</p>

<p>“I suppose so!” he answered, with something like a
sneer. “The mate, on a dollar and a half a day, is
always expected to do the captain’s work on this boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<p>“I shall not ask you to do mine; but are you dissatisfied
with your wages?”</p>

<p>“I think the pay is mean.”</p>

<p>“So do I; and from to-day your wages shall be two
dollars a day. I have already spoken to Colonel Wimpleton
about this matter, and he consents to it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; that’s handsome,” replied Van Wolter.
“Excuse me for what I said just now; I didn’t mean
anything by it.”</p>

<p>“All right. I want you to have the boat ready to
start in just seven minutes after she stops at the
wharf. And, to help the matter, you may say to
the hands that their pay shall be raised a quarter of
a dollar each per day. They must work lively when
we make a landing.”</p>

<p>“You are a gentleman and a scholar, Captain Penniman,
and what you need most time will give you.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“More years.”</p>

<p>He rang the bell, slowed the boat, and made as
beautiful a landing as I had ever seen in my life. The
moment the steamer touched the wharf he rushed
down the ladder to the forward deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>“Now, lively, my men!” shouted he, as he grasped
the handles of one of the trunks.</p>

<p>I saw him say something in a low tone to the
hands. I knew what it was, and the effect was electrical.
They worked well, and tumbled in the freight
with an alacrity which must have astonished the staid
citizens of that place who had gathered on the wharf.
It was Saturday, and there was a large quantity of
freight, and a great many passengers; but within the
seven minutes I had named the steamer was ready to
be off. I had saved half the time usually taken up
in this landing, and there was room to reduce it still
more.</p>

<p>“You are late again,” said a gentleman to Colonel
Wimpleton, as he came on board. “We shall lose the
train.”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know we shall. I think our people will have
to go over to Grass Springs and take the train.”</p>

<p>“We shall be on time, sir,” I ventured to say.</p>

<p>“I think we shall,” added the colonel.</p>

<p>“All aboard and all ashore!” shouted the mate, with<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
a zeal born of the half-dollar per day his pay had been
increased.</p>

<p>I sprang up the ladder, and took my place in the
wheel-house. It was just ten minutes past three. I
was five minutes inside of my own calculations, but
more than ten behind the steamer’s usual time. “The
tug of war” had come for me, for I intended to steer
the boat myself, and save from five to ten minutes of
the boat’s ordinary time. I must now explain, more
particularly than I have before done, how this feat
was to be accomplished.</p>

<p>As I have before stated, the South Shoe lay off the
town of Ruoara. It was exactly due west from the
wharf where the <em>Ucayga</em> made her landing. To the
southward and westward of this island the water was
shallow, and more than a mile was added to the distance
from Ruoara to Ucayga by going round these
shoals, or about five minutes to the time. But this
was not all. The boat was obliged to back, and actually
turn, before she could go ahead at full speed;
and this operation would consume all of five minutes
more.</p>

<p>I have before spoken of the narrow passage between<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
the Horse Shoe and the Shooter, where the Toppletonians
landed when they took possession of the former
island. This channel was very narrow, but it was
also very deep. I proposed to run the <em>Ucayga</em> through
this passage, and thus save ten minutes on the trip.
The steamer made her landing at the end of the wharf,
so that she did not have to turn; and all we had to
do, making the passage in the direction indicated, was
to cast off the fasts and go straight ahead.</p>

<p>Ruoara was built on a broad point of land which
projected out into the lake, so that the narrow channel
lay due north of the end of the pier. A straight line
through the channel, as the needle points, would strike
the North Shoe; and this circumstance rendered the
navigation beyond the passage rather difficult. But I
had thought of the problem so many times that I was
satisfied, knowing the channel as well as I did, that
I could take the steamer through without any trouble.</p>

<p>“Cast off your fasts and haul in the plank!” I
shouted from my position, as I grasped the wheel.</p>

<p>The zealous crew, inspired by the increase of their
wages, promptly obeyed the order. I rang the bell
to go ahead, just as Van Wolter entered the wheel-house.<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
Perhaps my readers may not feel much confidence
in my skill, and it may be necessary for me to
repeat the statement that I had spent a great deal of
time on board of the steamers on the lake, most of it
in the engine-room with Christy Holgate, it is true,
but not a little of it on deck and in the wheel-house.
I had often steered the boat. I had found the helmsman
was as willing to be relieved as my instructor,
the engineer, had been. I knew the wheel, and I
knew the bells. I rang to go ahead, and gave the
wheel a sheer to port.</p>

<p>“You want to back her first, don’t you?” suggested
Van Wolter, in a very respectful tone.</p>

<p>“No; I’m going to show you what I can do now,”
I replied, with a smile.</p>

<p>“But, captain, you will be aground in three minutes,”
protested the mate, laying his hand on the
wheel.</p>

<p>“Let me alone! Don’t bother me now,” I replied
rather sharply, as the steamer gathered headway.</p>

<p>I snapped the bell again, to go ahead full speed,
and away she buzzed toward the narrow channel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know about this!” exclaimed Van Wolter.</p>

<p>“I do; don’t say a word.”</p>

<p>He did not; but in half a minute more Colonel
Wimpleton and Waddie both appeared at the door of
the wheel-house, and rushed in, highly excited, and
evidently expecting to be smashed in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Wolf?” demanded the colonel
almost fiercely.</p>

<p>“To Ucayga, sir,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Stop her this instant!”</p>

<p>“Too late now, sir. I’m all right; I know what I’m
about,” I answered.</p>

<p>The boat rushed into the narrow channel.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE HORSE-SHOE CHANNEL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Wimpleton, Waddie, and the mate all held
their breath, as though they expected to see the magnificent
<em>Ucayga</em> knocked in splinters the next instant.
She was going at full speed through the narrow channel;
but, if I had been underneath her, I could not
have told any better how many feet and inches there
were between her keel and the sands at the bottom of
the channel. If the passage through this narrow
place was thrilling to others, it was more so to me,
and I was fully conscious of the responsibility that
rested upon me.</p>

<p>If the steamer struck the ground, it would be ruin
to me. My new-found situation, and all the emoluments
attached to it, would be lost. But I felt that
a failure to be on time at Ucayga would be hardly
less fatal to me. I had fought the battle faithfully
for the Lake Shore Railroad, when I was in the employ
of the company, and had never missed a train.
I intended to be equally faithful and devoted to the<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
steamboat company. I knew what was expected of
me, and I was determined that my boat should always
be on time.</p>

<p>Success was a duty. The first step toward a failure
was to believe in one. I had figured up my plan so
carefully that I knew what could be done, always
providing that the steamer was up to her guaranty. I
was thrilled by the situation; but I was confident and
determined. I could not take my eye off the course
for an instant to look at Colonel Wimpleton and his
son; but I could judge of their suspense and anxiety
by the breathless silence they maintained. If the
<em>Ucayga</em> took the ground, I should hear from them
then; and that would be as soon as I cared to have
the spell broken.</p>

<p>I had not yet reached the most difficult point of the
navigation. If I continued on my straight course, the
steamer would strike on the North Shoe, and the
problem to be practically solved was whether the boat
could be turned about forty-five degrees without being
swept upon the shoals to the northward. She was a
long vessel, and it required all the philosophy and science
I possessed to meet the question. When the<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
helm was put to starboard, the momentum of the
steamer would tend to throw her course outside of the
arc of the circle she would describe in turning. The
faster she went the greater would be her momentum,
or, after she had begun to turn, her centrifugal force.</p>

<p>I had studied a great deal over this question since
I visited Ruoara to purchase the <em>Belle</em>, for I was convinced
that this passage must be open to the boat in
order to enable her to compete with the railroad, by
saving at least ten minutes of precious time. I had
studied it over very carefully, with every possible allowance
for wind and current. I had chalked out
diagrams of the channel on the ceiling-boards of the
<em>Belle</em>, and my policy was thoroughly defined in my
own mind. The channel between the Horse Shoe and
the North Shoe was perhaps a hundred and twenty
feet wide&mdash;it did not vary twenty feet from this distance,
I knew. When the boat was within a hundred
feet of the bend in the channel, I rang to stop her.</p>

<p>“I thought you would have to back out,” said Colonel
Wimpleton, drawing a long breath, perhaps of
relief to find that the magnificent craft was not already
high and dry on the shoals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not going to back out, sir&mdash;by no means,” I
replied, as I threw the wheel over to starboard.</p>

<p>The <em>Ucayga</em> surged ahead under the impetus she
had attained, and turned her bow to the west, with
the shoal close aboard of her on the port side. She
minded her helm beautifully, and as soon as I had
brought the bow flagpole in range with the chimney
of a certain cottage on the west shore, I rang to go
ahead. Righting the helm, I let her go again at full
speed. The allowance I had made for the centrifugal
sweep of the boat carried me clear of the shoals on
the starboard hand; and, though I had hugged the
shoal on the port hand, the actual course of the boat
was very nearly in the middle of the channel. In a
couple of minutes more all danger had been passed.</p>

<p>“You may take the helm now, if you please, Mr.
Van Wolter,” said I to the mate.</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon,” roared Waddie, “we are
out of that scrape!”</p>

<p>“That was done as handsomely as ever I saw anything
done in my life!” exclaimed the mate, with a
broad grin on his good-natured face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Wolf,” said the colonel,<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
shaking his head, while the relief which he felt was
plain enough upon his face.</p>

<p>“You know that we have saved ten minutes by that
operation, sir,” I replied, looking at my watch. “It is
seventeen minutes past three and we have only nine
miles more to make which can be done in thirty-five
minutes. This will bring us in at the wharf at seven
minutes before four. We shall have at least five minutes
to spare. We should certainly have been behind
time if we had gone around the South Shoe.”</p>

<p>“But do you think it is safe to go through that
narrow place, Wolf?” asked the great man.</p>

<p>“I think I can take this boat through a thousand
times without failing once,” I answered, wiping the
perspiration from my brow, for the intense excitement
of the passage, overlooked and criticized as I was by
the magnate and his son, had thrown me into a fever
heat.</p>

<p>“If I had known what you intended to do, I would
not have permitted it.”</p>

<p>“For that reason, sir, I did not tell you,” I replied,
laughing. “I want to say, sir, that I haven’t done
this thing blindly and recklessly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed the mate, who understood
the matter better than any one present except myself.</p>

<p>“You said something to me a few weeks ago about
taking command of this boat, Colonel Wimpleton.
Well, sir, I have studied up this subject, and taken
the shore bearings. I can give you the precise rule
I followed.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear it,” said the colonel, bestowing
upon me a cheerful smile of approbation.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. When the pine tree on the Shooter ranges
with the barn on the east shore, stop her. Then, when
the north point of the Shooter ranges with an oak tree
on the east shore, starboard the helm. When the boat
has turned so that the chimney of the cottage ranges
with the bow flagpole, the pilot sighting from the
center of the wheel-house, go ahead again. Then you
are all right; and it can be done a thousand times
without a single failure if you follow the directions.”</p>

<p>“But why do you stop her?” asked the colonel
curiously.</p>

<p>“So that, in turning, the tendency to sweep too
far to starboard may be counteracted in part. But<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
after I have tried it a few times, I can go through
without stopping her.”</p>

<p>“You are a genius,” laughed the colonel. “I begin
to hope that we shall beat the railroad, after all.”</p>

<p>“We are sure of it every time we can leave Centreport
at two-thirty.”</p>

<p>“The up-lake boats must get to Centreport as soon
as that in order to enable the train to be on time,”
replied Colonel Wimpleton, rubbing his hands as
though he was master of the situation.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are quite ready for Major Toppleton’s
next step,” I replied, rather amused at his
want of forethought.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by his next step?”</p>

<p>“The one I should take myself if I were in his
place.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I think we are beating him just now, sir; and, as
soon as the major finds out that we are getting ahead
of him, he will make another move. We are sure of
the Centreport and Ruoara trade, as long as we are
on time. He can’t get that away from us. But we
want our share of the up-lake business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>“Yes and we must have it,” added the great man
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Major Toppleton has bought up the stock of the
old line of boats, and runs them to favor the railroad.
The only possible motive he can have for sending his
boats to Centreport is for the accommodation of passengers
from Hitaca to that place. There are only a
few of them. His next step, then, will be to run his
boats only to Middleport, so that you shall not have
an opportunity to catch a single through passenger.”</p>

<p>“That occurred to me,” replied the colonel.</p>

<p>If it had occurred to him, he had been singularly
careless about providing a remedy.</p>

<p>“It will be done just as soon as the major sees that
we can make our trip from Centreport to Ucayga in
one hour and a half, including the stop at Ruoara. I
am satisfied you will see the posters announcing a new
arrangement within a week.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that I can help myself,” added the
magnate, biting his lips with vexation.</p>

<p>“Don’t you, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” continued the colonel, opening his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>“If you wish it, you can have the entire control
of the travel on this lake. After you have made your
next move, Major Toppleton and the railroad will be
nowhere.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Wolf.”</p>

<p>“You must build the mate to this steamer as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather a costly experiment,” mused the
great man.</p>

<p>“But it will pay, for you will have the entire travel
on the lake, with the exception of the three towns
on the railroad. The through travel pays the bills,
and you can have all that. Those old boats make
only ten miles an hour, and it takes them three hours,
including stops, to come from Hitaca to Centreport.
The <em>Ucayga</em> would make the distance in two. Your
line can leave the head of the lake an hour later than
the old line, and get to Ucayga in three hours and a
half, while it will take the old line four hours and a
quarter.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Wolf!” exclaimed the colonel. “I’ll
build another boat at once, and call her the <em>Hitaca</em>.<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
Let me see you to-night, when you get in, and we will
talk it over again.”</p>

<p>The <em>Ucayga</em> was approaching the railroad wharf.
The Lightning Express train was just coming in
sight, at least ten minutes behind time. When my
boat touched the wharf it was just eight minutes of
four.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DECIDED VICTORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The up-lake boat had arrived at Centreport rather
later than usual. Certainly the <em>Ucayga</em> had left her
wharf a full ten minutes behind her ordinary time.
The steamer had had even a less favorable chance than
before, and, under her former management, she must
have been fifteen or twenty minutes behind time. I
had saved at least five minutes of the stay at Ruoara,
and ten more by going through the Horse-Shoe
Channel.</p>

<p>The two trains which met at Ucayga were due at
five minutes of four. They were seldom more than
five minutes behind time, and as they were both
obliged to make connections, they could not wait many
minutes for either boat or cars. “On Time,” therefore,
meant something; and it was an inexpressible
pleasure to me that I had complied with the conditions.
Boat stock would go up after this feat had been performed<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
a few times, especially if the Lightning Express
was, as on the present occasion, ten minutes late.</p>

<p>The steamer from Hitaca had arrived at Centreport
at about half-past two. She had left for Middleport
as soon as she could take in and discharge her freight;
but she must have been five minutes late for the express
train. Lewis Holgate had probably wasted five
minutes more. When the <em>Ucayga</em> was made fast at
the wharf, the train had just reached the ferry on the
other side of the river&mdash;the outlet of the lake. The
trains east and west were on time, and by four o’clock
all the passengers who were going in them were in
their seats. The ferry-boat had not yet started. The
conductors stamped their feet, and looked at their
watches every half-minute. To wait for the Lightning
Express passengers would add ten minutes more to
the time to be made up in running about twenty-five
miles.</p>

<p>As the boat on the other side did not start, the conductors
decided not to wait any longer. The bells
rang, and the two trains puffed, and snorted, and went
on their way. I have no doubt there were many hard
words used by the people on board of the ferry-boat,<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
as they saw these trains start. If Major Toppleton
was on board, I had no doubt he used some big words,
for he was not above the infirmity of doing so when
irritated.</p>

<p>Steamer stock went up, and railroad stock went
down. In a fair competition, we had beaten the
Lightning Express. I was satisfied that this calamity
to the railroad, under the circumstances, would cost
Lewis Holgate his situation; for the major, and even
Tommy, would be indignant at the result. I was confident
that what we had done this time could always
be done, for we had made our quick time against a
strong head-wind.</p>

<p>“We have done it, Wolf!” exclaimed Waddie, as
he came up to me, with a familiar slap on the back,
after the trains left.</p>

<p>“Yes; and we have done it under rather unfavorable
circumstances,” I replied, quite as pleased as he
was with the result.</p>

<p>“No matter, so long as we have done it. If we can
only keep doing it I shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“We can; as long as we can leave Centreport at<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
half-past eight in the morning, and half-past two in
the afternoon, I will guarantee to land the passengers
here at five minutes before ten and five minutes before
four. Of course some accident may happen once or
twice a year, but the rule shall be without any ordinary
exception.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could compete with them going the
other way,” said Waddie anxiously.</p>

<p>“I wish we could; but I don’t think that will be
practicable until we have another boat. With one
more steamer, we can have it all our own way,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Can’t we do anything, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“If the up-lake boats will be ten or fifteen minutes
late in leaving Centreport, we may; but we can’t
promise to land passengers there in season to continue
their trip by the next boat. You must not promise
anything which you are not sure of performing.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could do something,” added Waddie.
“I would give anything to beat the railroad both
ways.”</p>

<p>“We can mend the matter; but I don’t think we can<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
always be sure of connecting with the Hitaca boat.
Let us see. Our time-table now is:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Time schedule">
<tr><td class="tdl1">Leave Ucayga</td><td class="tdr1">4.15.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl1">Arrive at Centreport</td><td class="tdr1">5.45.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>We can improve this, I think,” said I, writing on a
card the places and times as I stated them.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Time schedule">
<tr><td class="tdl2">“Leave Ucayga</td><td class="tdr1">4.00.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl1">Arrive at Centreport</td><td class="tdr1">5.25.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>That is twenty minutes better than we do now.”</p>

<p>“But the Hitaca boat is advertised to leave Centreport
at 5.15,” interposed Waddie, looking over my
figures.</p>

<p>“She is advertised to do it, but lately she has been
regularly ten or fifteen minutes behind time,” I replied.
“To-day she will be nearer half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Try it on, Wolf,” said Waddie, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I will; but you must not go before your advertised
hours.”</p>

<p>“That will make no difference. We are advertised
to go on the arrival of the boats and trains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Then what are we waiting for?” I replied. “All
aboard!” I called to Van Wolter, the mate.</p>

<p>My zealous assistant shouted the usual warnings,
and passengers on the wharf, who were waiting for
the ferry-boat, were invited to come on board. Some
of them accepted the assurance of Waddie that we
should connect with the Hitaca boat at Centreport, and
took passage with us. Just as the <em>Middleport</em>, with
her indignant passengers, approached the wharf, the
<em>Ucayga</em> backed out, and commenced her trip up the
lake.</p>

<p>“You appear to be in a hurry, Wolf?” said Colonel
Wimpleton, taking a seat with me in the wheel-house,
where Van Wolter had the helm.</p>

<p>I showed him the card on which I had written out
the time I proposed to make.</p>

<p>“We can leave Ucayga at four o’clock as well as
quarter of an hour later,” I added. “The Lightning
Express cannot land a passenger in Centreport in a
minute less than an hour and a quarter. We can make
our sailing-time in just that space. If we can save five
or ten minutes of our stay at Ruoara, we need not be<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
more than five or ten minutes behind this time in
reaching Centreport.”</p>

<p>“Do as you think best, Wolf,” replied Colonel Wimpleton,
with the most friendly smile I had ever seen on
his face.</p>

<p>“We shall get to Centreport first to-day, without a
doubt.”</p>

<p>We discussed the matter for a while, but we were
satisfied that nothing more than a temporary advantage
could be gained until we had another steamer. Before
the <em>Ucayga</em> reached the islands I took a walk through
the boat. Among the passengers I met quite a number
whom I had known on the Lightning Express, and
was very kindly congratulated upon my advancement.
Some of them laughed at the idea of a boy like me
commanding such a steamer; but I defended myself
from the charge of being a boy. I should soon be
seventeen; my mustache was beginning to develop
itself, and I was only a few inches shorter than my
father. Younger fellows than I had done bigger
things than to command a lake steamer. I had shaved
myself every week or fortnight for six months, borrowing
my father’s razor when he was away, and performing<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
the operation in the secrecy of my chamber,
with the door bolted, to prevent the possibility of an
interruption, and the consequent annoyance of being
twitted.</p>

<p>I made a desperate resolve, after being “bothered”
for my juvenility, to purchase a razor and other
implements, and shave myself every day, so as to
encourage the downy growth upon my upper lip and
chin. I also decided to have a frock-coat, and to wear
a hat, in order still further to obviate the objectionable
circumstances of “the young captain of the <em>Ucayga</em>
steamer.” I regarded it as rather malicious in people
to insist upon it that I was a boy. I was not a boy.
I was at least a young man, and I was doing a man’s
work. They might as well call a man of thirty a boy
because he played baseball.</p>

<p>In my tour of inspection I called upon my father in
the engine-room. I had not seen him since the boat
left Centreport. Like a faithful engineer, he had
looked only at the machinery before him, and not
troubled himself about other matters. He hardly
knew anything of the exciting events in which he had
been a prominent actor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>“How goes it, Wolf?” he asked, as I sat down in
his armchair.</p>

<p>“First-rate.”</p>

<p>“Have you quarreled with Waddie or the colonel
yet?” he inquired, laughing.</p>

<p>“No, sir, and am not likely to do so at present. I
am not on the top of the wave. We have beaten
the Lightning Express down, and are going to do the
same thing up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t overdo the matter, and don’t promise more
than you can perform.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to do so. I know just what I can
do, and I’m going to do it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t commit yourself to Waddie or his father,
Wolf. Either of them would kick you out of your
high place as quickly as he put you into it.”</p>

<p>“I think everything is going well now, father. The
colonel intends to build another boat immediately, and
by next spring nobody will trouble the Lake Shore
Railroad, except those who live upon the line.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too confident.”</p>

<p>“I know it! I have been studying up this steamboat<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
business ever since I was discharged by Major
Toppleton.”</p>

<p>“You are down on the major hard now,” said my
father.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not. I don’t wish him any harm; but
while I’m paid for serving the steamboat company, I
intend to serve it. I’ve nothing to do with the great
men’s quarrels; but I’m going to be on time, and do
the best thing I can for my employers. I’m going to
put her through by daylight.”</p>

<p>By this time the steamer was approaching the
Horse-Shoe Channel, and I went up to the wheel-house.
I had taken the bearings so as to pilot the
boat through in this direction as well as in the other.
By the same process, and with the same precautions, I
steered the <em>Ucayga</em> safely through the narrow passage,
and we reached the wharf at Ruoara about three minutes
inside of the time I had proposed, for the strong
wind helped us in going up the lake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TOMMY TOPPLETON MOUNTED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“On time!” exclaimed Waddie, as I came out of
the wheel-house, after the boat was secured at the
wharf.</p>

<p>“Yes, and more too,” I replied. “We are ahead of
the Lightning Express this time.”</p>

<p>“I want to be reasonable, but I never felt so much
like crowing as I do to-day. By the great horn spoon,
I think we have all been asleep on this side of the lake
since the <em>Ucayga</em> commenced running,” added Waddie,
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Van Wolter was already moving the freight and
baggage on shore; and his zeal had not suffered a
particle of diminution. He worked well, and did not
permit a single instant to be wasted. We had only
two trucks, but all the luggage and merchandise they
could contain had been piled upon them; and they
held nearly all we had to be landed. I wanted two
more of these machines, for they could be loaded by<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
the shore men before the arrival of the boat. Then
we need stay only long enough to wheel the two
trucks on board ashore and the two on the wharf to
the deck. I expected to reduce the delay to three or
five minutes.</p>

<p>I stood on the hurricane-deck, by the wheel-house,
where I could overlook the operations of the mate and
the deck-hands, and be in readiness to start the boat
the instant the last piece of freight was on board. I
was delighted with the zeal of the mate, and, I may
add, with his politeness and discretion. He did not
break things, and he did not tip over the passengers
as they came on board. He did not yell like a wild
Indian, and say impudent things to gentlemen who
incautiously placed themselves in his way. I liked the
man, notwithstanding his contempt for me as a boy,
manifested at our first meeting. Perhaps I should not
blame him for that; but when I had taken the boat
through the Horse-Shoe Channel, he had done me full
justice, and I forgave him. He was my friend, and I
was very glad to have done a good thing for him in
causing his wages to be raised.</p>

<p>The other steamer would be ready the following<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
spring, and I could not help thinking that Van Wolter
would make a first-rate captain for her. At any rate,
if he continued to do as well by me as he had thus
far, I was determined to speak a good word for him.</p>

<p>“Mr. President, I shall be obliged to ask the company
for two more trucks for this landing,” I continued,
turning to Waddie.</p>

<p>“You shall have a hundred if you want them,” replied
the little magnate.</p>

<p>“We want only two; and perhaps two more for
Ucayga, so that we can get rid of these long delays.”</p>

<p>“You shall have everything you want, Wolf. I
don’t see why we can’t beat the Lightning Express
every day.”</p>

<p>“We can never do it when the train is on time; and
I tell you Major Toppleton is too smart to let things
drag on the other side as they do just now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they can go through on time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they can. The engineer who is running the
dummy now will see that the train is never behind
time when they give him the place. I never missed a
connection while I was on the road.”</p>

<p>“Lewis Holgate is not you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>“But the major will not let him ruin the enterprise
much longer.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! what can the major do as long as Tom
Toppleton chooses to keep Lewis on the engine?”</p>

<p>“Well, Tommy won’t choose to keep him there.”</p>

<p>“I think he will.”</p>

<p>“But Major Toppleton has another string to his
bow. Our cake will be dough in a week or so at the
most&mdash;just as soon as the major fully understands the
matter; and I think it won’t take him more than a
week to see through the millstone.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say that he will not let his boats come
to Centreport.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Then you can’t get a single through
passenger. That is what we are coming to in a short
time, unless we find some way to counteract the
major’s plan.”</p>

<p>“Well, can’t we find some way?” asked Waddie
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can. I haven’t had time to think of
the matter much,” I replied, as Van Wolter ordered
the men to cast off the fasts and haul in the plank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>I went into the wheel-house, rang the bell, and the
<em>Ucayga</em> moved on. I gave the helm to the mate as
soon as he came up. Waddie went below to talk with
his father, to tell him, I suppose, that our victory was
to be but a transient one.</p>

<p>“How’s the time, Captain Penniman?” asked the
mate.</p>

<p>“Five minutes of five,” I replied, consulting my
watch, and thinking of Grace Toppleton, as I always
did when I saw it, for she had presented it to me in
behalf of the Toppletonians.</p>

<p>And I was at variance with them now! No, not
with many of them; only with Tommy and a few of
his toadies. But I did not like to wear the watch,
which had been the gift of those on the other side, for
which Major Toppleton had probably paid the lion’s
share, after the disagreeable events which had occurred.
The thought came to me that I ought to
return it to the donors; but this was rather a violent
alternative for saving my pride.</p>

<p>“We were not more than ten minutes at the Ruoara
landing, then,” added the mate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>“No; you have done admirably, Mr. Van Wolter,
and I thank you for your zeal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right! I always mean to do my duty
while I have any sort of fair play,” answered the gratified
man.</p>

<p>“We must do our duty whether we have fair play
or not,” I added. “That’s my motto.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that.”</p>

<p>“Two wrongs don’t make a right. The safest, and
indeed the only way for us, is always to do our duty.”</p>

<p>“I rather think you are right, after all. We are
waxing the Lightning Express over there, this afternoon.
That short cut through the Horse-Shoe Channel
did the business for us.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; and I’ve been thinking of it for a long
time. I suppose if I had mentioned it before I did it,
I should have been laughed at.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact. You have done a big thing to-day,
young man; I beg your pardon&mdash;Captain Penniman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t stand on any ceremony! We shall be
good friends; and while we stick together, we can
accomplish any reasonable thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t I hear you and the colonel saying something
about another boat like this one?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the colonel intends to build another&mdash;to be
called the <em>Hitaca</em>&mdash;at once.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is too soon to say anything yet; but I
want the command of that boat when she is built,”
continued Van Wolter anxiously.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that very thing myself; and, if
you are always as faithful as you have been to-day, I
think you will deserve it. I shall mention the matter
to the colonel and Waddie as soon as I get a chance.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; thank you, captain. That’s very handsome
of you; and you shall never have any cause to
complain of me,” he replied warmly.</p>

<p>“Of course, I can’t promise anything; but I will do
what I can, if everything is right,” I answered.</p>

<p>We discussed the former management of the boat,
and I explained to him my plans for the future. We
were in perfect accord, and I was glad that I had so
soon removed all grounds for jealousy, and all tendencies
to pull in the opposite direction, on the part of my
subordinate. We were approaching Centreport. The<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
train on the railroad, now ten minutes behind time,
was coming into Middleport, on the other side of the
lake. At twenty-five minutes past five we were fast
to the wharf. The boat going up the lake had not yet
left the pier. To my surprise, I found we had quite a
number of up-lake passengers, who had taken the
word of our runners that we should be in time for
the boat at Centreport. We had kept the promise, but
it would not always be safe to make it.</p>

<p>We arrived in season to enable Colonel Wimpleton
to send for his satchel, and when the steamer for
Hitaca touched the wharf he went on board. He was
determined not to lose a day or an hour in laying
down the keel of the new steamer, and he was going
up the lake to make his contracts for this purpose.
The boat started on her trip, and my work for the
day was finished. Everybody on board was in remarkably
good spirits. For the first time, really, the
steamer had beaten the Lightning Express; and we
intended to “keep doing it” as long as the achievement
was possible. I gave the boat into the keeping
of Van Wolter, and went on shore. My father could<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
not leave until he had put the engine in order. As
everybody’s wages had been raised, there was no
danger of a conspiracy against the new order of things.</p>

<p>Not until the excitement of the afternoon’s stirring
work had subsided did it occur to me that I was engaged
to go up the lake on Monday with a party in
the <em>Belle</em>. Of course it would be impossible for me
to keep my engagement to the letter, though I intended
to do so in spirit. The long-desired opportunity
of doing something for Tom Walton now presented
itself. My friend was a thorough and competent
boatman, fully my equal, if not my superior. His
mother was poor and in ill-health, so that she depended
mainly upon him for her support. He was, in
my estimation, a splendid fellow; and his devotion to
his mother, and his constant self-sacrifice for her sake,
won my regard and admiration. I had long desired to
give him a situation worthy his abilities and character.</p>

<p>Embarking in the <em>Belle</em>, I crossed the lake. After
mooring the boat, I went directly to the house of
Tom’s mother, and was fortunate enough to find my
friend at home. He lived in one of the smallest and<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
meanest dwellings in Middleport. I was determined
to do a good thing for him, and I thought, after the
boat season was finished, I ought to have influence
enough, as the commander of the <em>Ucayga</em>, to procure
him a first-rate situation for the winter. He came out
of the house, and before I had time to open my business
with him, the Toppleton Battalion, which was out
for drill, came round the corner, and we suspended our
conversation to see the parade.</p>

<p>Major Tommy Toppleton was at the head of the
column. He had nearly recovered from his broken
leg; but he was not able to walk much yet, and was
mounted on a medium-sized pony. The moment he
saw me, he halted his battalion, and urged his steed
almost upon me.</p>

<p>“You villain, Wolf Penniman!” said he, still urging
on his pony, as though he intended to crush me under
the iron hoofs of the little charger.</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t I hold your horse for you?” interposed
Tom Walton, with his inimitable good-nature, as he
seized the bridle-rein of the animal.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” roared Major Tommy, striking<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
my friend a sharp blow on the back with the flat of
his sword.</p>

<p>I was indignant, and inclined to pull the bantam
major from his horse; but I remembered his broken
leg, or perhaps I should have done so.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TOMMY TOPPLETON THREATENS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Tom Walton always had a pleasant way of doing
an unpleasant thing. I suppose he thought Tommy
Toppleton intended to ride over me, or at least intimidate
me by the movements of his high-spirited little
charger, and, as a friend, he considered it his duty to
do something in my defense. This was the reason
why he asked if he should not hold the little major’s
horse.</p>

<p>I had hardly seen Tommy since he had broken his
leg; but I had no difficulty in believing that he hated
me. He was haughty, tyrannical, and overbearing,
even to a greater degree, when incensed, than my new-made
friend Waddie Wimpleton. He seemed to think
I had no business to live, and move, and have my being,
after I had ceased to be serviceable to him. He
wanted to crush me, and the demonstration of his pony
was only suggestive of what the rider really desired
to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>Tom Walton was a tough fellow, and not at all
thin-skinned, in the literal signification of the term.
He did not mind the blow which Tommy had given
him; but, putting himself on the left of the horseman,
and out of the convenient reach of his weapon, he
backed the pony out into the middle of the street.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” shouted the major, struggling to
hit, and then to punch, my friend with the sword.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly! I’ll let him alone first-rate,” laughed
Tom, as he released the steed from his iron grasp.</p>

<p>“You puppy, you!” snapped Tommy, foaming with
wrath that a plebeian, like my companion, should venture
to take hold of the bridle of his pony. “How
dare you touch my horse?”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t much pluck; but I didn’t want
him to tread on Wolf’s corns.”</p>

<p>“Wolf’s a rascal, and you’re another!”</p>

<p>“Then we are well matched,” chuckled Tom Walton.</p>

<p>“If I don’t clean you fellows out of this place, it
will be because I can’t!” snarled Tommy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Major Toppleton?” I inquired,
my indignation entirely appeased by the pleasant manner
in which my companion had treated the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>“Wolf, you are a traitor!” exclaimed Tommy, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You are an adder, that bites your best friends!”</p>

<p>“I think you are an adder, major, for you are adding
one hard word to another,” laughed Tom Walton.</p>

<p>“Don’t give me any of your impudence!”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; I leave that to my betters.”</p>

<p>“Wolf, I only halted to tell you that Middleport
will soon be too hot to hold you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Tommy?” I asked
gently.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean, well enough. You are
a traitor, and are willing to bite the hand that feeds
you.”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“What have we done for you? Where did you get
that watch and chain in your pocket?”</p>

<p>“My friends on this side of the lake gave me the
watch and chain.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, my father paid for it!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall take the liberty to return it to him,”<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
I replied. “If you will relieve me of it now, it is at
your disposal.”</p>

<p>I took the watch from my pocket, detached the
chain from my vest, and offered it to him.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it. It only shows what a fellow you
are. After all we have done for you, Wolf, you go
over on the other side, and do all you can to injure
us&mdash;to injure the Lake Shore Railroad.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to call your attention to the fact that
you discharged me,” I answered mildly. “I must
work for a living, and when the president of the
steamboat company offers me a situation at three dollars
a day, I can’t afford to refuse it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you!” sneered he. “Allow me to call your
attention to the fact that, after all we have done for
you, on this side, you got up a row in the car, and
broke my leg.”</p>

<p>“You got up the row yourself, as you will remember,
if you recall the facts. You insisted upon putting
two passengers out of the car after they had paid their
fare, and while they were behaving themselves in a
proper manner.”</p>

<p>“You thought you were going to rule the Lake<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
Shore Railroad. You tried to do it; and that was
what made the row. Do you suppose I would submit
to your dictation? Do you think I had not the right
to discharge an employee of the road? I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Probably we shall not make much by discussing
the matter here, though, if you wish to do so, I will
meet you for that purpose when and where you
please,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I’ll meet you on Monday forenoon, at ten o’clock,”
said he suddenly and maliciously.</p>

<p>“I am engaged then. Of course I mean any time
when my business will permit.”</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t mean what you said,” added
he, turning up his nose and pursing out his lips. “I
want to give you a fair warning. The Wimpletons
wouldn’t have you on the other side after you had
turned traitor to them. I don’t blame them; and we
won’t have you on this side after you have turned
against us. If you mean to stay on this side of the
lake, you must have nothing to do with that steamer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think our family has a right to live on
this side of the lake?” I inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>“No matter whether you have or not. We won’t
have you here,” replied Tommy sharply.</p>

<p>“I think we shall stay as long as we think it best to
do so. I will return this watch to your father, and
then I believe I shall not owe him anything.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t my father save all the property you had
when Wimpleton foreclosed the mortgage?”</p>

<p>“He did; he was very kind to us then, and we shall
always gratefully remember all that he did for us,
though he was not called upon to pay out a single
dollar on our account.”</p>

<p>“And for this you are doing your best to ruin the
Lake Shore Railroad, which cost my father two hundred
thousand dollars! Deny that, if you can!”
stormed Tommy.</p>

<p>“I do deny it.”</p>

<p>“Are you not running that steamer on the other
side?”</p>

<p>“I have that honor.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t she beaten the Lightning Express-train
twice to-day?”</p>

<p>“If she did, it was in fair and honorable competition.<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
You discharged me, and you are responsible for
the consequences, not I.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of talking to an ingrate, like you!”
exclaimed the major impatiently. “I give you fair
warning that I intend to clean you out of the place,
the whole kit of you, Tom Walton included.”</p>

<p>“All right! It is your next move, Tommy. I hope
you won’t burn your fingers in the scrape, as you have
done several times before.”</p>

<p>“Do you threaten me?”</p>

<p>“No, by no means. I only wish to tell you that those
who act unjustly must bear the burden of their own
injustice. When you attempted to have me put out of
the car, it cost you a broken leg, though that was by no
act of mine. I shall try to keep the peace, but if attacked,
I shall defend myself. For all the good you
and your father have done to me and mine, I shall remember
you kindly. I shall forgive and forget all the
injury. I stood by you and your father as long as you
would let me. I refused the very situation which I
have now accepted when in your employ, for no money
could tempt me to forsake my friends. I hope you
will not try to get up a quarrel with me, Tommy, for<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
I have no ill-will towards you, and would rather serve
you now than injure you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word I do!” I answered earnestly; and
if I know my own heart, I spoke the simple truth.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we will give you a chance to prove what
you say,” said Tommy, with an incredulous shake
of the head. “Attention&mdash;battalion! Forward&mdash;march!”</p>

<p>As abruptly as he had come upon me, he left me.
Evidently my words had suggested some plan to him,
and I had a right to expect some proposition from him.
To sum up Tommy’s threats, he intended to drive me
out of the town&mdash;not by force or by legal measures,
but by making “the place too hot to hold me;” which,
being interpreted, meant that he and his friends would
vex and annoy our family until we should be glad to
seek a new home elsewhere. Of course a man so influential
as Major Toppleton, senior, had the power to
make Middleport very disagreeable to us.</p>

<p>“Tommy’s dander is up,” said Tom Walton, as the
battalion marched up the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t take much to bring his wrath up to the
boiling-point,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I think you have given them an awful heavy dose
to-day, Wolf, if all the stories are true,” added Tom,
rubbing his hands as though he enjoyed the situation.</p>

<p>“What stories?”</p>

<p>“They say that Colonel Wimpleton, or Waddie,
made you captain of the <em>Ucayga</em>.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.”</p>

<p>“And your father the engineer.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, too.”</p>

<p>“Then the boat beat the Lightning Express both
ways.”</p>

<p>“All true.”</p>

<p>“There’s a big excitement on this side of the lake.
Everybody says Lewis Holgate must step down, and
take the dummy.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing.”</p>

<p>“Can you beat them then, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“We can beat them on the down trip from Centreport.
But we don’t expect to do much till next spring;
then the Lake Shore Railroad may hang up its fiddle<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>,
except for business with Middleport and the towns
upon the line.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Tom, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>“No doubt of it. But I wanted to see you about
another matter. Have you any work on hand?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but odd jobs,” replied Tom, suddenly
looking as sad as it was possible for so good-natured
a fellow to look. “I must find something to do that
will pay me better, or it will go hard with my mother
this winter. She isn’t able to do much.”</p>

<p>“I can put you in the way of doing something for a
week or two, which will pay you pretty well. The
<em>Belle</em> is engaged to go up the lake next week with a
fishing-party; but, as things are now, I can’t go with
her.”</p>

<p>“I’m your man!” exclaimed Tom, his eyes sparkling
with pleasure, for this was a job after his own heart.</p>

<p>“All right. Let us settle on the terms.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you may fix them to suit yourself.”</p>

<p>“How much are you making now, Tom? I don’t
want to be hard with you.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be hard with me,” laughed he.</p>

<p>“But let us have the matter understood. I will do<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
as well as I can by you. How much do you earn
now?”</p>

<p>“Some days I make a quarter of a dollar; some
days a half; and I have earned a dollar. If I get
three dollars a week I am pretty well satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I am to have five dollars a day for the boat when
she is taken by the week, and seven for a single day.
Suppose I give you two dollars a day for every day
the <em>Belle</em> is used.”</p>

<p>“That’s handsome!” exclaimed Tom. “I shall be
rich on those terms.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t. She will not have anything to do
for more than two or three weeks this season. In the
spring she will do well. After she is paid for, we will
divide equally.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Wolf. You are a glorious fellow!”</p>

<p>We went down to the <em>Belle’s</em> moorings, and I gave
my friend such instructions as he needed. I was sure
my party would have no reason to regret the change
in the skippership of the boat.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE TWO MAJORS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Tom wanted to sail the <em>Belle</em> a while, in order to
ascertain her points; and though it was now dark, he
unmoored her, and stood up the lake. After I had
called upon the gentleman who had engaged the <em>Belle</em>,
to explain the change in my arrangements&mdash;which, as
the person knew Tom very well, were entirely satisfactory&mdash;I
went home. My father had just returned
from the other side; and I found our family in the
most cheerful frame of mind. Our star appeared to be
in the ascendant again.</p>

<p>“I have been warned out of town, father,” said I, as
we sat down to supper.</p>

<p>“Who warned you?” asked my father, with a smile
which indicated that he did not consider the warning
as of any great consequence.</p>

<p>“Tommy Toppleton. He halted his battalion, and
pitched into me as though he intended to crush me
beneath the hoofs of his pony.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>I went on to explain what the little major had said;
but none of us were alarmed. My mother counseled
moderation, as she had always done, and father
thought we could make the most by minding our own
business.</p>

<p>“I told Tommy I would rather serve him than injure
him; and if I know myself, I spoke the truth,” I
added.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Wolfert! I’m glad you said that, for
I know you meant it,” said my good mother. “While
we do our duty, and endeavor to serve the Lord faithfully
and patiently, we shall triumph in the end. It
does not make much difference if we are cast down for
a time, or if wicked men seem to have conquered us,
we shall prosper if we are good and true. We can
afford to wait for success as long as we do our duty.
As the minister said last Sunday, God does not always
call that success which passes for such in this world.
Real success is being ever faithful to God and conscience.”</p>

<p>I believed what my mother affirmed; but it always
did me good to hear her repeat the lesson of wisdom
and piety. It always strengthened my soul, and helped<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
me to maintain my standard of duty. My father was
not a religious man, though he always went to church,
and had a high respect for sacred things. He always
listened in silence to the admonitions of my mother;
but I was sure he approved them, and believed in them.</p>

<p>Before we rose from the table, the door-bell rang,
and my mother, who answered the summons, informed
me that Major Toppleton desired to see me immediately
at his own house.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” asked my father, manifesting
much interest in the event.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but the message reminds me of what
Tommy said when we parted,” I replied.</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“When I told him I would rather serve than injure
him, he replied that perhaps I might have a chance to
prove what I said.”</p>

<p>“It may be that the major intends to make you an
offer,” added my father. “I have no doubt he feels
very sore about the events of this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Very likely he does, for we certainly beat the
Lightning Express all to pieces; and I am confident
we can do it every time we try, on the down trip.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>“Suppose he should make you an offer?” inquired
my father anxiously. “What if he should offer you
three or four dollars a day to run the Lightning Express?”</p>

<p>“I am glad you asked the question, father, for my
mind is made up. I may be wrong, but I think I am
right. I should decline the offer.”</p>

<p>“If he offered you more wages than the colonel
agreed to pay you?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Wimpleton has fairly engaged me to run
the <em>Ucayga</em>,” I replied, taking my hat from the nail.
“It would not be right for me to leave him without
giving him reasonable notice of my intention to do so.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. As long as he uses you well, you
are bound to do the same by him, whatever happens.”</p>

<p>“I refused to leave the railroad company when the
colonel offered me more wages than I was receiving.
He has given me my place in good faith. If I can do
better on this side of the lake than I can on the other,
I think I have the right to resign my situation, if I
give reasonable notice.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Wolf,” replied my father warmly.<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
“Major Toppleton discharged us both without an
hour’s notice, and I don’t think we are under special
obligation to him for his recent treatment of us,
though he certainly did us a good turn when we were
persecuted by Colonel Wimpleton.”</p>

<p>My father and I were in perfect accord, as we generally
were on questions of right and of policy; and I
hastened to the major’s house, not without a certain
dread of confronting the great man. I was admitted
to the library. I had hoped I should obtain at least a
sight of Grace, but I did not; and I braced my nerves
for the interview with the great major and the little
major, for both of them were present. The father
bowed loftily and haughtily as I entered, and the son
looked supercilious and contemptuous. Neither of
them was courteous enough to invite me to take a
seat, and I stood up before them, waiting their imperial
pleasure.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, Major Toppleton, and I have
come,” I ventured to say; and the cold reception accorded
to me had a tendency to make me stand upon
my dignity.</p>

<p>“I find, to my surprise, that you have gone into the<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
employ of Colonel Wimpleton,” said the senior major,
with a sneer upon his lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I replied, bowing.</p>

<p>“I am astonished!” added the major.</p>

<p>“Neither my father nor myself could afford to remain
without employment, when good offers were
made to us,” I answered respectfully.</p>

<p>“Then I am to understand that you and your father
have arrayed yourselves against me.”</p>

<p>“By no means, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you not understand that Wimpleton’s steamer
and the Lake Shore Railroad are running against each
other?” demanded my late patron severely.</p>

<p>“I do, sir; but I do not think that a fair business
competition means any personal ill-will. If it does, it
is entirely a matter between you and Colonel Wimpleton.
I am not the owner of the <em>Ucayga</em>, and she will
run just the same whether I go in her or not.”</p>

<p>Major Toppleton bit his lips. Perhaps he felt that
my point was well taken.</p>

<p>“You ran the steamer this afternoon, and, by your
knowledge of the Horse-Shoe Channel, made a quick
trip. Those who know say you took the steamer<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
through in fifteen minutes less than her usual time. I
hold you responsible, therefore, for this day’s work.”</p>

<p>“Of course I did the best I could for my employers,
as I was in the habit of doing when I ran on the railroad.”</p>

<p>“After doing as much as I have for you and your
father, I did not expect to see you both arrayed against
me.”</p>

<p>“But you discharged us both, sir. What could we
do? We could not afford to refuse good offers.”</p>

<p>“If the Evil One should offer you a price, would
you sell your soul to him?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly not, sir. It did not happen to be the
Evil One who made us the offers, and they were accepted.”</p>

<p>“It was the same thing!” exclaimed the major bitterly.</p>

<p>“Let me talk, father,” said Tommy, who, by a
miracle which I could not comprehend, had thus far
remained silent.</p>

<p>His father let him talk, and, like an obedient parent,
was silent himself.</p>

<p>“Wolf, you said you would rather serve me than<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
injure me,” continued the little major, fixing his gaze
upon me.</p>

<p>“I did; and I meant so,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Suppose I should offer to give you back your place
on the locomotive.”</p>

<p>“It will be time enough to answer when you have
done so.”</p>

<p>I had no idea that he intended to make me any such
offer. The sneers and the looks of contempt bestowed
upon me were sufficient assurances that neither father
nor son regarded me with any other feeling than aversion.
It was not necessary gratuitously to decline the
offer in advance, and thus provoke their anger.</p>

<p>“Suppose I should make you the offer,” repeated
Tommy, rather disturbed by my evasive reply.</p>

<p>“As you have not made it, I need not answer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to make an offer, and then have it refused.”</p>

<p>“I do not like to say what I will do till I have an
opportunity to do it,” I answered.</p>

<p>“You need not bother your head about it. I don’t
intend to make you an offer. I only wanted to show<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
you that you did not mean what you said about serving
me,” continued Tommy spitefully. “I wouldn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop a minute, Tommy,” interposed his father.
“Wolf, after all we have done for you, we have a
right to expect something better of you.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do, sir?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Do! I’ll tell you. Go to Wimpleton to-night.
Resign your situation. Then come to me, and I’ll talk
with you about a place for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop a minute, father,” said Tommy. “Don’t
make any promises. I wouldn’t have him on the Lake
Shore Railroad any more than I would have Wimpleton
himself. He’s a hypocrite&mdash;would rather serve
me than injure me! Let him resign his place on this
steamer! That would be doing something to serve me.
After that it will be time enough to talk.”</p>

<p>I made no reply, for it was patent to me that Tommy
had sent for me merely to bully me. It was easier and
cheaper to bear it than to resent it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think you can ruin the Lake Shore
Railroad, in which I have invested so much money,”
sneered the senior major.</p>

<p>“I have no desire to do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>“But you are trying to do it,” added Tommy.</p>

<p>“I intend to work for the interests of my employers.
If I have an opportunity to serve you, I shall do so,
but not by being unfaithful to those who pay me for
my work.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what you did when in my employ,”
said the father. “You made your peace with Wimpleton
in my yacht, feeding him and taking care of him
at my expense.”</p>

<p>“I did only an act of humanity toward him,” I answered,
stung by the charge.</p>

<p>“No matter! You are a traitor and a renegade. Go
your way, and take the consequences of your treachery.
But let me tell you and Wimpleton that when I have
made my next move, your steamer might as well be at
the bottom of the lake as to attempt to compete with
the road.”</p>

<p>I bowed, and left, though I did not escape till
Tommy had again poured out the vials of his wrath
upon me. If the major had published his “next move”
to the world I could not have understood it any better.
The up-lake steamers were no longer to make a landing
at Centreport, where the <em>Ucayga</em> could get any of<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
her through passengers. I went home and told my
father the result of the interview. He only laughed
at the impotent rage of the two majors.</p>

<p>Early on Monday morning, as my father and I were
pulling across the lake in my old skiff, we saw the
<em>Grace</em>&mdash;Major Toppleton’s yacht&mdash;get under way and
stand up the lake. This movement explained what occurred
on the arrival of the morning boat from Hitaca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE MAJOR’S NEXT MOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On Monday morning, at quarter-past eight, the
<em>Ucayga</em> was in readiness to start as soon as the steamer
should arrive from Hitaca. She was in sight, and our
runners were on the wharf, prepared to induce through
travelers to leave her for our more elegant and spacious
boat. Waddie was on board, as excited as
though the success of the whole scheme depended entirely
upon him.</p>

<p>The up-lake steamer was approaching the Narrows;
but, instead of heading directly toward the pier on the
Centreport side, as usual, she hugged the west shore.
We did not suspect that any change in her movements
would be made at present; at least not before it was
duly announced in the advertisements and posters of
the company. I expected to hear of a different arrangement
in a week or two, after Major Toppleton
had thoroughly tested the capacity of the railroad and
steamers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>“What does this mean, Wolf?” demanded Waddie
blandly, as the Hitaca boat stopped her wheels near
the Middleport landing.</p>

<p>“It means that she is not coming to Centreport with
her through passengers,” I replied, hardly less chagrined
than the president of the steamboat company.</p>

<p>“But she has no right to do that,” protested Waddie,
who, like the two great men, had the idea that no one
could be justified in acting contrary to his interest and
his wishes.</p>

<p>“I suppose the owners of that line have the right to
run their boats where they please.”</p>

<p>“But they have not advertised any change in their
arrangements.”</p>

<p>“They are responsible for what they do,” I added.</p>

<p>“They must have passengers on board who wish to
come to Centreport.”</p>

<p>“Probably the boat will come over here after the
<em>Ucayga</em> starts. Of course this is a plan on the part of
Major Toppleton to prevent us from taking any of his
through passengers. We can’t expect the railroad
company, which controls those boats, to play into our
hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>“But we can expect fair play.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” I replied.</p>

<p>“But what can we do?” demanded Waddie, intensely
nettled by this movement of the other side.</p>

<p>“We can do nothing, just now. I expected this
thing, though not quite so soon.”</p>

<p>“As the matter stands now, we are beaten.”</p>

<p>“Just now we are; but I think we shall not stay
beaten long,” I continued good-naturedly. “Your
father understands the matter perfectly, and has not
lost a moment in preparing for the emergency. When
we have the other steamer, we shall be on the top of
the wave again.”</p>

<p>“But must we keep quiet until the other boat is
completed?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, Waddie, though we cannot fully compete
with the other side till we have the new boat. I
wonder if your father came down in that steamer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think not. He has not had time
to do his business in Hitaca.”</p>

<p>“I have a plan to propose and, when we have time,
I will talk it over with you.”</p>

<p>“You always have a plan to propose,” said Waddie,<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
beginning to look more hopeful. “Perhaps I will see
you when you return, for I must go to school this
morning. I haven’t forgotten what I said on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“I hope not. If I were you, I would not say anything
to any one that I had made certain good resolutions.
Let them find it out by your actions rather
than your promises.”</p>

<p>“I will, Wolf; but I am so excited about that
steamboat business that I can’t think of much else.”</p>

<p>“Control yourself, Waddie. Do your duty faithfully
at school, and I will try to have everything go
right with the boat.”</p>

<p>“I am vexed at this change in the running of those
boats. It throws us completely out of our plans.”</p>

<p>“We must expect such things. We can’t have it
all our own way, and we must make the best of the
circumstances as we find them.”</p>

<p>“Major Toppleton is smart.”</p>

<p>“I told you he would not be content to have the
wind taken out of his sails. He rose early this morning,
and went up the lake in his yacht. Probably he
went on board of that steamer at Gulfport, and directed<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
her captain to proceed directly to Middleport,
instead of coming to Centreport first.”</p>

<p>“What is your plan, Wolf? I am curious to know
about it. Do you mean to start from Middleport?”</p>

<p>“No, we can’t do that. Major Toppleton controls
the water-front of the town, and we could not get a
landing-place there.”</p>

<p>“But don’t my father control the water-front on
this side? Don’t we let the major’s boats land here?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; and it would be very unwise in your
father to prevent them from doing so; for he would
thus shut off from Centreport all direct communication
with Hitaca, and the other towns up the lake.
When he has established a through line, he can afford
to keep his wharves for the exclusive use of his own
boats, though I question the policy of doing so, even
then.”</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon, Wolf, you have a long
head!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Waddie!”</p>

<p>“But you have not told me about your plan.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I have not time to do so now,” I replied,
looking at my watch. “It is nearly half-past eight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I will see you when you return from
Ucayga.”</p>

<p>Waddie remained with me till I gave the order to
cast off the fasts and haul in the planks. It was evident
by this time that the boat from Hitaca was not
coming to Centreport until after we had started; and
at precisely half-past eight the <em>Ucayga</em> left the wharf.
We had quite a respectable number of passengers,
though, of course, we had not a single one from up the
lake; and, under the new arrangement, we could not
possibly have one in the future. It was certainly
vexatious, as Waddie had suggested, to be checkmated
in this manner, and I knew that Colonel Wimpleton
would storm furiously when he heard of it.</p>

<p>I had expected it; and, after the first shock, I felt
reconciled to the misfortune. Under the present arrangement,
the <em>Ucayga</em> accommodated only Ruoara
and Centreport, and till we could offset the movement
of Major Toppleton, she must be run only for their
benefit. There was not more than half business
enough to support her. The plan which I had devised,
and of which I had spoken to Waddie, had its advantages
and its disadvantages; but I was sure that it<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
would be a paying operation for the steamer. I was
very anxious to state it to the colonel and Waddie.</p>

<p>As soon as the <em>Ucayga</em> left the wharf, the Hitaca
boat started for Centreport. The major did not intend
to lose any Centreport trade, and by the arrangement
he saved his up-lake passengers for that town.
Doubtless he was a happy man, and Tommy was satisfied
that he had again thrown the magnificent steamer
into the shade. Well, they had, to a certain extent;
but it was our next move.</p>

<p>We were at the wharf in Ruoara on time; for the
<em>Ucayga</em>, under favorable circumstances, rather exceeded
her rate of sixteen miles an hour. Waddie had
sent up the two trucks which I required, and we made
our landing in about five minutes. I took the wheel
when the boat left the wharf, and carried her safely
through the Horse-Shoe Channel; and this time without
a particle of the nervousness which had disturbed
me before. I gave Van Wolter the bearings, so that
he could be preparing himself for the task when occasion
should require.</p>

<p>But, really, there was now no reason to go through
the narrow channel. As we had no possible chance of<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
obtaining any through passengers, it was useless to
wait for the up-lake boats, though under my proposed
arrangement it would have enabled me to save the
day. The mate carefully noted the bearings I pointed
out to him, and the operations which I explained. He
was a skilful man in his business, and I had no doubt
he would soon be a competent pilot for the channel.</p>

<p>While we were going through the passage, the
Lightning Express dashed along the other side of the
lake; and I was satisfied, from its increased speed and
punctuality, that Lewis Holgate had been superseded.
The locomotive was evidently under the charge of a
skilful hand. But the spirited competition of Saturday,
which I had anticipated would continue for a few
days, seemed to be at an end. The <em>Ucayga</em> was on
time, and so was the train. The passengers from the
latter came over on the ferry, and as they landed, I
saw Major Toppleton and Tommy. A great crowd of
people had come down on the Lightning Express, the
larger part of whom were through travelers.</p>

<p>To my surprise, my late patrons walked towards the
boat. Both of them looked extremely pleasant, as well
they might, after the large freight they brought down,<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
at two dollars a head, from Hitaca. They saw me, as
I stood on the hurricane-deck, overlooking the landing
of our merchandise.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Wolf,” said the senior major. “I
hope you are very well this morning.”</p>

<p>“Quite well, I thank you, sir,” I replied, as cheerfully
as I could.</p>

<p>Both majors laughed; they could not help it after
the victory they had won; and I tried to laugh with
them, but it was rather hard work. The father and
son came on board, and presently joined me on the
upper deck.</p>

<p>“This is a magnificent boat, Wolf,” said the great
man.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, she is a very fine boat,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I had no idea she was so well fitted up. You did not
have many passengers down&mdash;did you, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“Not so many as we desired, sir.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you remember what I said Saturday
night?” chuckled the major.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I told you it was my next move.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I recollect that you said so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Wolf, I have made that move.”</p>

<p>“I see you have, sir; and, without any disrespect to
you, perhaps Colonel Wimpleton will conclude to make
the next move himself.”</p>

<p>“The next move!” laughed the major. “We think
on our side, that we have him in a tight place.”</p>

<p>“He don’t think so himself, Major Toppleton; and
I’m sure I don’t.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Wolf?”</p>

<p>“You seemed to be very much pleased with your
success, and I congratulate you upon it. It’s all fair.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s all fair; but what is your next
move?” asked the major, trying to conceal a shade of
anxiety that crossed his face.</p>

<p>“As you did not tell me what your move was to be,
I think I will keep still for the present, especially as it
is not yet matured.”</p>

<p>“That’s all gas, Wolf,” interposed Tommy. “You
can’t do nothing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can’t; but we can try,” I replied, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>The ferry-boat rang her bell, and my guests departed,
though I offered them a passage in the <em>Ucayga</em>.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">GRACE TOPPLETON FAINTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was certainly our next move, and after the <em>Ucayga</em>
left the wharf, I went into my stateroom, abaft the
wheel-house, to make some figures relating to my plan.
My apartment was a little parlor, and though I had
scarcely been into it before, I was very much pleased
with it. Besides a berth, in which a nice bed was made
up, the stateroom was provided with a desk, lockers
for books and papers, a couple of armchairs, a table,
and other suitable furniture.</p>

<p>This was not the traditional “captain’s office” to
which passengers are invited to step up by the boy
with the bell. The office was abaft the port paddle-box
on the main deck; and the <em>Ucayga</em>, in anticipation of
doing a large business, was provided with a clerk, so
that I had nothing to do but attend to the navigation
of the boat.</p>

<p>I felt like a lord in my palatial little room, and I
was rather sorry that the exigencies of the service did<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
not require me to sleep in it. I sat down at my desk,
and was soon absorbed in my calculation. In my own
opinion, I had a splendid idea&mdash;one which would induce
Major Toppleton and his son to call me a traitor
again as soon as it was reduced to practise. I had not
time to finish writing out the program before the mate
called me, as the <em>Ucayga</em> approached the Horse-Shoe
Channel.</p>

<p>I took the boat through the difficult passage, and
after we had made the landing at Ruoara, I returned
to my room, and finished writing out my plan. Then,
with the aid of a handbill which hung up in the apartment,
I drew up an advertisement of the proposed new
arrangement suitable for the newspapers and for
posters, so that, the moment it was approved by Colonel
Wimpleton, it could be printed.</p>

<p>I was much excited by the brilliant scheme I had
devised, and I was not quite sure that I could not
throw the Lake Shore Railroad into the shade, even
with one steamer. Certainly with two, the road would
be reduced to the condition to which the major had
condemned the <em>Ucayga</em>&mdash;that of doing merely a local
business for the towns on its own line. I was very<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
sorry that Colonel Wimpleton did not return by the
morning boat, for I was impatient to show him my figures,
and to have the new program inaugurated without
any delay.</p>

<p>If the short trips of our boat had done nothing else,
they had hurried up the Lake Shore Railroad; for,
when we reached Centreport, the train had arrived,
and the boat for Hitaca had started. Doubtless Major
Toppleton and his son continued to be perfectly happy,
and believed that they had achieved a decisive and final
victory. For the present they had; but it was our next
move. As I had nearly three hours to spare, and as
Waddie did not appear on board, I went home for an
hour, taking the steamer’s jolly-boat, with two deck-hands,
to pull me across the lake.</p>

<p>I landed at the steps near the steamboat wharf, and
had hardly ascended to the pier when I had the fortune
or the misfortune to confront Tommy Toppleton.
In the enjoyment of his great victory, he had come
down to witness the arrival of the <em>Ucayga</em>, ten or fifteen
minutes after the departure of the Hitaca boat.
He looked quite as pleasant as when I had met him
down the lake, a couple of hours before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“How are you again, Wolf?” said he, halting before
me on the wharf.</p>

<p>“First-rate,” I replied. “I hope you are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, all but my leg, and that is doing very well.
I only limp a little now. You are not on time to-day,
Wolf.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; I thought I was. The <em>Ucayga</em> was at
her wharf at eleven-twenty-five. That was on time,
and a little ahead of it.”</p>

<p>“But you were not in season for your passengers to
go up to Hitaca in the boat which has just gone.”</p>

<p>“No, I was not; but then, you see, we had no passengers
for Hitaca. We did not insure any one a connection
at Centreport to-day, and so none came by our
boat. I did so on Saturday, because your train was
ten or fifteen minutes behind time.”</p>

<p>“Well, that won’t happen again,” added Tommy
confidently.</p>

<p>“You haven’t fallen out with Lewis Holgate&mdash;have
you?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;oh, no! But I persuaded him to go on the
dummy, where he is more at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>“I was satisfied you had some one on the locomotive
who understood the business.”</p>

<p>“Lewis and I are as good friends as ever.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that.”</p>

<p>“Are you, Wolf?” sneered Tommy.</p>

<p>“Certainly I am.”</p>

<p>I had my doubts whether Lewis Holgate was as
good a friend as ever; for, being degraded from the
locomotive to the dummy would rankle in his heart,
however well he succeeded in concealing his real feelings.</p>

<p>“You haven’t resigned your situation as captain of
the steamer&mdash;have you, Wolf?” asked the little major,
with a sinister expression.</p>

<p>“I have not.”</p>

<p>“On the whole, I think I wouldn’t do it, if I were
you,” he added, laughing.</p>

<p>“I did not think of doing so, unless the circumstances
required such a step.”</p>

<p>“Because we are having it all our own way on this
side, and we are perfectly willing you should do anything
you please now.”</p>

<p>“That’s handsome; that’s magnanimous, Tommy;<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
and I thank you for your condescension,” I answered,
as cheerfully as I could. “I am very pleasantly situated
just now, and it affords me very great pleasure
to know that anything in the way of fair competition
will not be considered as interfering with your rights
and privileges.”</p>

<p>“Do anything you like, Wolf. You will be beaten
both ways, now, and I think you have come about to
the end of your rope. After Colonel Wimpleton has
spent so much money on that new steamer, we ought
not grudge him the little business he can obtain in
Centreport and Ruoara.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you feel so, Tommy, and that I have
your kind permission to take any step I may think
proper.”</p>

<p>“Do just what you think best now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to say that my opinion of your conduct
toward us is at all changed; but as I look at it,
your treachery will be its own reward.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather cool, Tommy. After turning me off
with every indignity and mark of contempt you could
devise, you talk about my treachery!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>“We won’t jaw about that. I don’t love you now;
but we won’t quarrel, if you will only take yourself
out of Centreport.”</p>

<p>“We may not find it convenient to do that immediately;
but probably our business will require us to
leave soon.”</p>

<p>“We have made our next move, and we are satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t find any fault when we make
ours.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” sneered the little major. “You
can’t do anything now.”</p>

<p>“You may be mistaken; but I hope you will take it
as kindly as we do, if things should not go to suit
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“I have your permission to do what I think best,”
I replied, walking up the pier.</p>

<p>The little major evidently saw no possible way by
which the <em>Ucayga</em> could compete with the railroad, as
long as the Hitaca boats did not land first at Centreport.
I did. I walked to my father’s house, thinking
over what he had said, and anticipating the storm<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
which would take place when my plan was carried out,
as I was confident it would be, as soon as it was submitted
to Colonel Wimpleton.</p>

<p>“There has been a gentleman here to see you,
Wolfert,” said my mother, as I went into the house.</p>

<p>“Who was he?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Portman, or Captain Portman, I think he said.
He was very anxious to see you.”</p>

<p>“Portman, Portman,” I replied, repeating the name,
and trying to recall the owner thereof, for it sounded
familiar to me.</p>

<p>“He is a stout gentleman, and wore gray clothes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” I exclaimed, pulling out my pocket-book,
and taking therefrom the card of the stout
stranger who had pitched Tommy Toppleton out of
the car on the railroad.</p>

<p>“He told me, if you came over to-day noon, to send
word to him at the hotel.”</p>

<p>My mother accordingly sent the message by one of
my sisters; and, while she was absent, I related all the
events of the forenoon. Presently Captain Portman
presented himself. He was very glad to see me, and<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
spoke of me very handsomely, to my face, for my conduct
on the railroad.</p>

<p>“As you are no longer in the employ of the Lake
Shore Railroad, Wolf, I thought I would like to offer
you a place,” he said. “But your mother tells me you
have a good situation now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I am running the new steamer from
Centreport to Ucayga.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry you are engaged, though I congratulate
you on your splendid situation. I am going to keep a
yacht at my place, near Hitaca, and I wanted you to
take charge of her next spring, and I will give you
plenty of work, and good pay for the winter.”</p>

<p>“I am very much obliged to you for your kind
offer; but as things stand now, I shall be obliged to
decline.”</p>

<p>“I see you must; but I am glad to meet you, for I
took a fancy to you. My place is only five miles from
Hitaca, and I should be pleased to see you there.”</p>

<p>We talked for half an hour about affairs on the
lake, and I invited him to dine with me; but he was
engaged with a friend at the hotel. Just as he was
taking his leave, we heard a timid pull at the door-bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Grace Toppleton,” said my mother, showing
her into the room where we were, which was the
parlor.</p>

<p>“Grace!” I exclaimed, delighted to see her.</p>

<p>But I perceived in an instant that she was intensely
agitated, and I realized that her visit was not one of
ceremony. Indeed, I could not help fearing that some
terrible calamity had happened.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Wolf! I am&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Take a chair, Miss Grace,” I interposed, as she
gasped, and seemed to be entirely out of breath.</p>

<p>I placed the rocking-chair for her, and she began to
move toward it. Then I saw that her face had suddenly
become deadly pale. Her step tottered, and she
was on the point of falling to the floor, when I sprang
to her assistance, as did my mother also at the same
time. I received her into my arms, and bore her to
the sofa.</p>

<p>“Bless me, the poor child has fainted! What can
have happened to her?” exclaimed my mother, running
for her camphor-bottle.</p>

<p>Though it was not very strange that a young lady<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
should faint, I was utterly confounded by the situation.
Something had occurred to alarm or agitate
her; but I could not imagine what it was. I looked out
the window; but I could see not even a horse, cow, or
dog, to terrify her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">GRACE TOPPLETON’S STORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>My mother had the reputation of being a skilful
person in sickness, or in any emergency. She devoted
herself earnestly to the restoration of Grace.
I could not help looking at her, alarmed as I was, while
she lay pale and beautiful on the sofa. Captain Portman
manifested a deep interest in the sufferer, though
he knew that she belonged to the family of my persecutor,
for the male members of which he had
strongly expressed his contempt and disgust.</p>

<p>I tried again to devise some explanation of the
singular visit of Grace at our house, and of the violent
emotion which agitated her. Although I knew that
her father was indulgent to her, I was afraid that
everything was not pleasant at home. I had seen her
brother strike her a severe blow, and had heard him
talk to her in the most violent manner. If he would
behave thus brutally to her in the presence of others,
what would he not do in the privacy of his own home?<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
Grace was conscientious, and with the highest views
of truth and duty.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to believe, therefore, that some
trouble had occurred in the family of the great man
of Middleport, and that poor Grace had fled from her
home in fear of personal violence. I began to flatter
myself, in view of the fact that she had come to me for
protection, and to fancy myself already a knight-errant.
I had all along rejoiced in the belief that she
regarded me with favor and kindness; but this last act
of confidence crowned all my hopes. While I was
thinking what I should do for her, how I should shield
her, she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>My mother continued her benevolent ministrations
until Grace was wholly restored. Probably she was in
the habit of fainting; at any rate, she came out of the
swoon with a facility which astonished me, and led me
to the conclusion that fainting was not the most serious
thing in the world, as I had supposed when I saw
her silent and motionless on the sofa. She seemed to
gather up her faculties almost as suddenly as she had
been deprived of their use.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wolf, I came to see you,” said she, after she<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
was able to speak. “I am sorry I fainted; but I have
not felt well to-day.”</p>

<p>“Rest yourself, Miss Toppleton,” interposed my
mother. “Don’t try to talk much yet.”</p>

<p>“I feel much better now, and shall do very well. I
am much obliged to you Mrs. Penniman, for your
kindness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not a bit!” exclaimed my mother.</p>

<p>“But I must do the errand which brought me here,
and go home,” said Grace, rising from the sofa.</p>

<p>“Don’t get up yet, Miss Toppleton; sit still,” added
my mother, gently compelling her to resume her place
on the sofa.</p>

<p>“I feel quite well now. I always faint when anything
disturbs me. Mr. Wolf, I have something to
say to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I will go,” said Captain Portman.</p>

<p>“Not yet, if you please, sir,” interposed Grace.
“What I have to say concerns you, also. My father
and my brother will be terribly incensed against me
if they know that I have been here.”</p>

<p>“They shall not know it from any of us,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that my brother hates you, Mr. Wolf,<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
and sorry that my father indulges all his whims. My
mother and I think that they do very wrong; but we
can’t help it. Just before I came away from home, I
heard them talking together about the gentleman who
put my brother out of the train at the time his leg
was broken. That was you, sir, I believe?”</p>

<p>Captain Portman bowed his acknowledgment of the
fact.</p>

<p>“They were talking about arresting you, sir, and
taking you before the court for an assault upon
Tommy.”</p>

<p>The stout gentleman smiled, as though it were not a
very serious matter.</p>

<p>“But I don’t think I should have come here if this
had been all,” continued Grace. “My brother saw and
recognized you in the street, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” nodded Captain Portman.</p>

<p>“Dear me, I must hurry on with my story, or I
shall be too late to do any good!” exclaimed the fair
visitor. “Well, my brother is determined that you
shall be arrested, too, Mr. Wolf. He insists that you
were concerned in the assault. They have gone to
find an officer now. Tommy says he shall prevent<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
your running that steamboat this afternoon, and perhaps
for a week; and this is really what my brother
wants to do, so far as you are concerned, Mr. Wolf.”</p>

<p>Was this all? And Miss Grace had not been driven
from her home by the persecution of her father and
brother! Tommy had not even struck her again! I
was really glad, when I came to think of it, that the
matter was no worse. If I had no opportunity to do
desperate deeds in the service of my beautiful friend,
I had the consolation of knowing that there was no
occasion for any. I was happy to realize that peace
reigned in the great mansion.</p>

<p>When my anxiety for Grace would permit me to
think of myself, I appreciated the obligation under
which she had placed me by this timely warning. I
was willing to be arrested for my agency in expelling
Tommy from the train, for, being entirely innocent, I
could afford to face my accusers.</p>

<p>“Now, what will you do, Mr. Wolf?” asked Grace,
beginning to be much agitated again.</p>

<p>“First, I shall be under everlasting obligations to
you for your kindness in taking all this trouble on my
account.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind that, Mr. Wolf,” she said, blushing.
“I know you had nothing to do with injuring my
brother, and I do not want you to suffer for this, or to
have your steamboat stopped for nothing. The constable
and Tommy are going to wait for you at the
corner of the street,” she added, indicating the place
where I was to be captured. “You must go some
other way.”</p>

<p>“I will, Miss Grace.”</p>

<p>“And I will go and throw myself into the hands
of the Philistines at once,” added Captain Portman,
laughing.</p>

<p>“I suppose they can’t hurt you, sir,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Well, I am certainly guilty of the offense charged
upon me,” replied Captain Portman. “I will not now
pretend to justify it, though your brother was very
unreasonable, and detained me, as well as a crowd of
others, without the slightest excuse for doing so. The
act was done in the anger and excitement of the moment,
and I shall cheerfully submit to the penalty of
the law, as a good citizen should do.”</p>

<p>I thanked Miss Grace again for her interest in me,
and for the trouble she had taken on my account.<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
What she had done was no trivial thing to her, as her
fainting fully proved, and I could not but be proud of
the devotion she had exhibited in my cause. She took
her leave; and after she had been gone a few minutes,
Captain Portman departed.</p>

<p>Tommy’s plan included me in the arrest for an assault
upon him; but that was only a conspiracy to injure
the steamboat line on the other side of the lake. I
deemed it my duty to defeat this little scheme, in the
interests of my employers. I ate my dinner hastily,
and then left the house by the back door, making my
way to the lake, where I had left my skiff, by a round-about
course. I pulled across, and as I went on board
of the <em>Ucayga</em>, I hoped the constable who was waiting
for me would have a good time.</p>

<p>I was not quite sure that Grace had not made a
mistake, so far as I was to be connected with the arrest.
She might have misunderstood the conversation
she had heard; for I could hardly believe it possible
that Major Toppleton intended to have me arrested.
Everybody knew that I had had no hand in putting
Tommy out of the car. No one had ever asserted such
a thing. But they could affirm that I was in company<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
with Captain Portman at the time, and that I had instigated
him to do the deed. Of course this was nonsense;
but it might be a sufficient pretense to detain me
long enough for the <em>Ucayga</em> to lose her afternoon trip.
The warning I had received induced me to prepare for
the future, and I instructed the mate to run the boat
through, if at any time I should be absent when it was
time to start.</p>

<p>I went into the engine-room, and told my father
what had transpired during my absence. He listened
to me, and seemed to be much annoyed by my story;
for it looked like the first of the petty trials to which
we were to be subjected, in accordance with Tommy’s
threats. While I was thus employed, Waddie Wimpleton
appeared, excited and anxious under the defeat
we had that day sustained.</p>

<p>“I am sorry your father did not come down this
morning,” said I, after he had expressed his dissatisfaction
at the movement of Major Toppleton.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Waddie hopefully.</p>

<p>“Because I have a plan to propose to him.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you propose it to me?” said he, laughing.</p>

<p>“I am the president of the steamboat company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>“I know you are; but I did not think you would be
willing to take a step so decided as the one I shall
propose, without the advice and consent of your
father.”</p>

<p>“Let me hear what it is, and then I can tell you
whether I will or not.”</p>

<p>“Come to my stateroom, then, and I will show you
all the figures. If I mistake not, we can do a big
thing, even before the keel of the <em>Hitaca</em> is laid down.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking a good deal about our affairs
to-day, Wolf,” said Waddie, as we went upon the
hurricane-deck. “I have tried to feel kindly toward
the folks on the other side. It’s hard work, and I’m
not up to it yet&mdash;by the great horn spoon I’m not!”</p>

<p>“You must not try to overdo the matter,” I replied,
pleased with his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“They are endeavoring to injure us all they can. If
Major Toppleton had not prevented his boat from
coming to Centreport this morning, it would have
been easier to feel right toward him.”</p>

<p>“You need not feel unkindly toward him on that
account. Major Toppleton, as an individual, is one
affair; his railroad and steamboat line is quite another.<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
A fair competition is all right. We will not say a
word, or do a thing, against the major or his son, personally;
but we must do the best we can for the success
of our line. We are in duty bound to do it, as much
for the public good as our own. If we lessen the time
between Hitaca and Ucayga by an hour, so far we
confer a benefit upon the traveling community. We
need have no ill-will toward any person. If the major
and his son need our help, our kind words, let them
be given. We will not say anything to injure their
line; but we will do the best we can to build up our
own.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t shorten the time between Hitaca and
Ucayga by an hour, or even a minute,” said Waddie.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall. Sit down, and I will show you
the figures,” I replied, as I took my program from the
desk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">OUR NEXT MOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I had written out a plan for the running of the
<em>Ucayga</em> an entire day. I had studied it out very carefully,
and made all the allowances I deemed necessary.
The basis of our anticipated success was the fact that
our boat would make sixteen miles an hour, while the
old steamers were good for only ten, or when crowded,
for twelve, at the most. Waddie looked at my time-table;
but he did not exhibit any enthusiasm, and I
concluded that he did not understand it.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” I inquired, somewhat
amused by the puzzled expression on his face.</p>

<p>“I dare say it is first-rate; but I don’t exactly know
what all these figures mean. I see Hitaca on the
paper, but of course you don’t mean to go up there.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I mean,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Go to Hitaca!” exclaimed Waddie.</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;go to Hitaca.”</p>

<p>“But my father promised the people of Centreport<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
and Ruoara that they should have two boats a day to
Ucayga, and if you go up to the head of the lake, you
can’t possibly make two trips a day from there.”</p>

<p>“That’s very true; nevertheless, we will go to
Hitaca once every day, and still make the two trips, as
your father promised.”</p>

<p>“Don’t understand it,” answered Waddie, hitching
about in his chair.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about it. We are in Centreport now.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; and I am willing to make an oath of
that,” laughed the president of the steamboat company.</p>

<p>“Good! We will begin here, then,” I added, pointing
to the name of the place on my time-table. “We
leave here at two-thirty, and arrive at Ucayga so as to
start from there at four.”</p>

<p>“Just so; that is the program now.”</p>

<p>“We follow the present arrangement in all respects,
but with a little addition. We reach Centreport at
five-twenty-five this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I understand all that,” said Waddie, rather impatiently.</p>

<p>“From that point we strike out a new track. Instead<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
of remaining at Centreport over night, we continue
right on to Hitaca, stopping on the way at Gulfport,
Priam, Port Gunga, and Southport. We shall be
in Hitaca at seven-thirty, about an hour ahead of the
railroad line.”</p>

<p>“That will give us a share of the through passengers,”
added Waddie, as he began to comprehend the
nature of my plan. “But I don’t see how&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, Mr. President,” I interposed.
“You agree that my method is all right so far?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“We beat the other line on the through run by about
an hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall take all, or nearly all, the through
passengers on the afternoon trip up; for none of them
will want to waste an hour on the passage. Besides,
we give them a perfect palace of a boat, compared
with the old steamers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall take them all!” exclaimed Waddie.
“There will be no changing, while the railroad line
must change twice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>“Still further,” I continued. “There is a train for
the south which leaves Hitaca at eight in the evening.
The old boats are always too late for it; we shall be
in season. That will help us again, for passengers
going beyond Hitaca will not have to remain there
over night.”</p>

<p>“We shall have it all our own way,” said Waddie,
rubbing his hands with delight.</p>

<p>“More yet; we can have supper on board, and that
will be another source of profit to the boat, and be an
accommodation to the passengers, who in the old line
have their supper at nine o’clock, after they get to the
hotel.”</p>

<p>“It’s all plain enough so far. You will stay in
Hitaca over night?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; and now for the rest of the plan,” I
continued, glancing at my program. “The old-line
boat leaves Hitaca at quarter of six in the morning,
so early as to be a very great annoyance to passengers.
We will leave at half-past six&mdash;three-quarters of an
hour later. We can have breakfast on board, which
the old boats cannot for the want of the facilities. We
shall touch at all the intermediate ports, and arrive at<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
Centreport by half-past eight, or so as to leave at our
usual time.”</p>

<p>“That’s first-rate!” exclaimed Waddie. “You get
this extra trip to Hitaca by running up at night and
down in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so; but we can make only one through
trip a day to Hitaca. We shall reach Ucayga at ten
in the forenoon, as we do now, and come right back on
the return trip. We go from the head to the foot of
the lake in three hours and a half, including stops.
The railroad line does the same thing in four and a
quarter.”</p>

<p>“They beat us a quarter of an hour between Centreport
and Ucayga, and we beat them an hour between
Centreport and Hitaca, making a balance of three-quarters
of an hour in our favor.”</p>

<p>“That tells the whole story, Waddie,” I replied.</p>

<p>“But how about the other trip?” asked the president
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Until the <em>Hitaca</em> is built, we must submit to be
beaten on that. We can’t go up to the head of the
lake twice a day with one boat. We leave Ucayga at
ten, but we come only to Centreport. In other words,<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
we shall make one trip a day to Hitaca, and two to
Centreport, from the foot of the lake.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good deal.”</p>

<p>“So it is; and, by this new arrangement, we shall
all have to work from about five o’clock in the morning
till eight or nine in the evening.”</p>

<p>“That will be rough on you.”</p>

<p>“But we shall have to do it only till the other
steamer is built. The boat will make a good deal of
money. The old line charges two dollars a passenger
for through tickets. We can afford to carry them for
a dollar and a half.”</p>

<p>“But what shall be done about it? This is all talk.”</p>

<p>“If your father were here, I think he would send
the boat to Hitaca this very night,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then I will do so,” added the president promptly.</p>

<p>“If there is any blame, I will share it with you.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Wolf! If you only beat the other line,
my father will be satisfied. I shall go up to Hitaca
with you.”</p>

<p>“I will have a stateroom ready for you, if you wish
to sleep on board.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Wolf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>“But we want some handbills, Mr. President, to
inform the public of the new arrangement. You can
have them printed so that we can take them as we return,
and have them ready to scatter all over Hitaca
when we get there to-night.”</p>

<p>“I will have them done.”</p>

<p>I sat down at my desk, and wrote the following advertisement:</p>

<p>Waddie took this copy, and hastened to the printing-office
with it. I was confident that this program
would carry consternation into the ranks of the old
line. After Waddie had gone, I went down to see<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
my father. I explained my plan to him, and told him
that the boat would go through to Hitaca that night.
He was a prudent man, and suggested some difficulties,
nearly all of which I had considered and provided
for. Except at Middleport, the wharves were free to
any one who chose to use them, so that there was no
trouble about the landings. Van Wolter was a pilot
for the upper part of the lake. As the public generally
were to be benefited by the new line, we had no opposition
to dread except from the railroad company.</p>

<p>At half-past two, the <em>Ucayga</em> left her wharf, and, as
usual, arrived at the foot of the lake just before four
o’clock. I had fully explained my purpose to the mate,
and to all on board, that they might make their arrangements
to be absent over night. The railroad passengers
were already in waiting when we reached
Ucayga, and the trains from the east and west were in
sight. Our runners were duly instructed to “ring in”
for through passengers, at a dollar and a half each,
with the time nearly an hour less than by the railroad
line.</p>

<p>This was really the first day of the exciting competition.<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
We had not yet unmasked our great battery,
and the victory was still with the Lake Shore Railroad.
I was not at all surprised to see Major Toppleton
and Tommy among the passengers, as we landed.
They had come up a second time that day to enjoy
their triumph, and perhaps, also, to look out for the
interests of their road. They were quite as pleasant
as they had been in the morning, and both of them
took the trouble to pay me another visit.</p>

<p>“Well, Wolf, how goes it with the new and splendid
steamer?” asked the magnate of Middleport.</p>

<p>“First-rate, sir.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to have any through passengers,”
laughed he.</p>

<p>“No, sir; none on this trip.”</p>

<p>“That is very unfortunate for the new and splendid
steamer,” he added, chuckling.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it is rather bad; but we have to make the
best of it. We hope to do better by and by.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will, for you seem to have plenty of
room to spare.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; rather more than we wish we had.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be obliged to have some new cars built, for
we had about two hundred through passengers by this
trip, and we could not seat them all in three cars.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have any built just yet, Major Toppleton,”
I answered pleasantly.</p>

<p>“There will be more passengers before there are
less. On our morning trip down, and our afternoon
trip up, we are always crowded,” chuckled the major.</p>

<p>“If you have more than you can accommodate comfortably,
we should be glad to take some of them.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you would, Wolf; but the fact of it is,
you are so slow that people will not ride with you.”</p>

<p>“No use, Wolf,” interposed Tommy. “You might
as well hang up your fiddle. You can’t compete with
the Lake Shore Railroad.”</p>

<p>“We never say die. We intend to have our share of
the business.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do; but you won’t have it,” said
Tommy, as the two trains came in, nearly at the same
time.</p>

<p>“Steamer <em>Ucayga</em>; new boat! Through to Hitaca!”
shouted our runners. “No change from boat<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
to cars! Magnificent steamer! Land you in Hitaca
at half-past seven, gentlemen! Fare only a dollar and
a half!”</p>

<p>Major Toppleton and Tommy looked aghast, and
turned to me for an explanation.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">UP THE LAKE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“What do you mean, Wolf?” demanded Tommy
Toppleton, turning fiercely toward me. “Have you
told your runners to lie to passengers?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” I replied. “They are telling only
the truth as I understand it.”</p>

<p>“The truth! Don’t you hear them?” angrily interposed
Major Toppleton.</p>

<p>“I hear them, sir. They are saying just what they
have been told to say. You will notice that they do
not utter a word against the railroad line.”</p>

<p>“But they say your boat is going through to
Hitaca!” exclaimed the major.</p>

<p>“So she is, sir.”</p>

<p>“To Hitaca!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I mean so.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand you that this boat is to run
through to Hitaca?” demanded the great man
fiercely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>“That is precisely what my words mean,” I replied
calmly. “You will remember that you made your last
move this morning. The president of the steamboat
company makes his last move this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“But this is absurd, and impossible. You don’t
mean it. It is intended to cheat passengers,” fumed
the magnate.</p>

<p>“All who go with us will be landed at Hitaca at
half-past seven this evening, if no accident happens.”</p>

<p>“But this boat was built to run from Centreport to
Ucayga.”</p>

<p>“That is very true, sir; but your move this morning
compelled the president to change his plans.”</p>

<p>“You can’t carry them out; and it is an imposition
upon the public.”</p>

<p>“All that we promise we shall perform.”</p>

<p>“But it is simply impossible.”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me, Wolf, that this boat can
make two trips a day between Hitaca and Ucayga?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I do not; we only propose to make one
through trip a day, with an additional one to Centreport.<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
On our ten-o’clock trip up we shall go only to
Centreport.”</p>

<p>“This is villainous!” said Major Toppleton, grinding
his teeth with rage.</p>

<p>“One of your mean tricks, Wolf!” added Tommy
savagely.</p>

<p>“Really you must excuse me, Tommy, but it was
only this morning that I had your kind permission to
take any step I thought proper. Didn’t you mean
so?” I replied.</p>

<p>“You are going to run an opposition line to Hitaca,
then?” growled the father.</p>

<p>“And do all you can to injure those who have been
your best friends,” howled Tommy.</p>

<p>“Why, I was told this forenoon to do what I
pleased. This is fair competition. If people wish to
ride on the railroad, they may do so. We will not
prevent them from going whichever way they please.
If you are not satisfied with your last move, you can
make another. I am sorry you exhibit so much feeling
about the matter,” I continued.</p>

<p>“Wolf, this is rascally,” said the major, as he saw<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
the passengers crowding on board of the <em>Ucayga</em>.
“You have cut under in the price, too.”</p>

<p>“The president of the steamboat company thinks
he can carry passengers for a dollar and a half.”</p>

<p>“But I will carry them for a dollar!” exclaimed the
major.</p>

<p>“For half a dollar!” added Tommy.</p>

<p>“I do not fix the prices for the steamboat company;
but I suppose they can carry passengers as
cheaply as any other line.”</p>

<p>“All aboard for Hitaca!” shouted the runners.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, this is an imposition!” shouted Major
Toppleton, beside himself with rage. “This boat goes
only to Centreport!”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you shall be landed at Hitaca at half-past
seven!” I cried, to counteract the effect of his
words.</p>

<p>“Passengers by the railroad for Hitaca&mdash;fare only
one dollar,” added the major.</p>

<p>“We’ll try this boat once,” said a gentleman in the
crowd.</p>

<p>By this time the trains were moving off, and the<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
travelers had chosen by which route they would go up
the lake. I ran up the ladder to the wheel-house.</p>

<p>“All aboard, and all ashore!” screamed Van Wolter,
as I gave him the word.</p>

<p>The planks were hauled in while the major and his
runners were vainly striving to influence the passengers
to leave the boat. We had them, and we kept
them. Most of them were attracted by the pleasant
aspect of the <em>Ucayga</em>, and desired to see more of her.
Many had doubtless heard of her, and were anxious to
give her a trial. We backed out from the wharf, and
were soon on our way up the lake. The people on
board were not a little disturbed by the insinuations
of Major Toppleton; for, coming from him, they
seemed to mean more than if uttered by the runners.
I assured them that we should perform to the letter all
we had promised. I explained the new plan to some
of the regular travelers, and the advantages of the
new line were so obvious that many of them volunteered
to patronize the line in future. We were on
time, and when the <em>Ucayga</em> arrived at Centreport, the
old boat had been gone about ten minutes. We saw
her less than two miles distant. Judging from the<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
number of passengers on board of the ferry-boat, she
had a very small freight. Our case would argue itself
with the traveling public, for no one could be so
stupid as to prefer the old line, with a change from
boat to cars, and from cars to boat again, and requiring
three-quarters of an hour longer time to make the
passage.</p>

<p>At Centreport Waddie appeared with a thousand
small handbills, for which I had provided the copy.
He brought his valise with him, and I saw that he intended
to be a passenger. He was of course very
anxious to see the working of the new arrangement.
Van Wolter hurried the freight ashore, and in five
minutes we were ready to continue our voyage. We
were now just fifteen minutes behind the old boat,
which we were to beat by forty-five minutes during
the trip.</p>

<p>Waddie had taken pains to circulate the information
that the <em>Ucayga</em> would go up the lake to Hitaca at
half-past five, and our crowd of passengers was considerably
increased by those who had chosen to wait.
The number on board was entirely satisfactory, and
her present trip would be a profitable one to her owner.<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
Waddie rubbed his hands with delight when he saw
how successful we had been in obtaining through passengers,
even before the new arrangement had been
advertised; but the steamer was so very attractive in
her appearance that travelers could not hesitate long in
choosing her.</p>

<p>“You have a big crowd on board, Wolf,” said Waddie,
after the boat started.</p>

<p>“We have been remarkably fortunate,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You have done a big thing for us, captain; and
the best thing I ever did was to make peace with you.”</p>

<p>“Because you are likely to make money by it!”</p>

<p>“Not that alone. I want to tell you, Wolf, that I
have kept my promise so far.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it, and I hope you will
persevere.”</p>

<p>“I am rather sorry this sharp competition between
the old and the new line comes in just now,” he added,
musing.</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because it is only increasing the ill-feeling between
the two sides of the lake.”</p>

<p>“It will afford you the better opportunity to be just,<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
if not generous. The competition on our part shall be
fair and honorable.”</p>

<p>“But we have cut under in price half a dollar on a
trip,” suggested Waddie.</p>

<p>“Two dollars is too much for a journey of forty-five
miles. The railroad line had a monopoly of the
through passengers, and charged what its officers
pleased. One dollar and a half is a fair price. We
will stick to that, if you and your father consent.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the major puts the price down to a dollar,
or even less?”</p>

<p>“He did that, at Ucayga, this afternoon. He offered
to carry all who would go with him for a dollar.
I don’t think many people will be willing to start
three-quarters of an hour sooner in the morning,
change twice in a trip, and go in those old boats for
the sake of saving half a dollar. However, that is
to be proved. But a hundred passengers, at a dollar
and a half, pays as well as a hundred and fifty at a
dollar.”</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon, won’t my father be astonished
when he sees the <em>Ucayga</em> putting in at
Hitaca!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>“No doubt of it.”</p>

<p>“He will approve what I have done, I know,” added
Waddie. “Do you suppose Major Toppleton has gone
up in the steamer ahead of us?”</p>

<p>“Probably he has; he will be too anxious to see the
working of the new arrangement to stay at home.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of some way to make peace
between our two families,” added Waddie.</p>

<p>“Have you, indeed? Well, that is hopeful,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I am afraid this rivalry will prevent any coming
together, even if my father were willing to make up.
Do you feel quite sure that we are doing right in running
opposition to the other line?” asked Waddie
seriously; and I could not help thinking of the proverbial
zeal of new converts.</p>

<p>“Let us look at it a moment,” I answered, willing to
take a fair view of the whole subject. “Before the
railroad was built, the boats charged a dollar and a
half from Hitaca to Ucayga, and went through without
any change. Then a Centreport passenger had to
cross the lake, go twenty miles by railroad, and then<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
cross back again. Half a dollar was added to the
price of passage from one end of the lake to the
other. Centreport was not accommodated, and was
overcharged. Is there any moral law which compels
people to submit to imposition? On the contrary,
ought they not to resist? The steamboat company
carries passengers quicker, more comfortably, and at a
less price. It is, therefore, doing the public a service,
though at the expense of the other line. Your course
is not only right, but commendable. All the people
and all the towns on the lake must not suffer in order
to make the Lake Shore Railroad profitable to its
owner.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are right; but I wish the competition
did not add to the ill-will between the two sides.”</p>

<p>Waddie appeared to be sincere; but it was visionary
in him to think of such a thing as reconciling the two
houses of Wimpleton and Toppleton, though, of
course, such an event was not impossible.</p>

<p>The <em>Ucayga</em> was approaching Gulfport. The old
boat had just made her landing there; indeed, she
started just in season to allow us to use the wharf. I
was rather afraid the bad blood of the major would<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
induce him to throw some obstacle in our way, but
nothing of the kind was attempted here. We landed
our passengers; but the other boat had taken all who
were going up the lake, which she was not to be allowed
to do at the other ports.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A TRICK OF THE ENEMY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next port was Priam, eight miles distant; and
the <em>Ucayga</em> dashed merrily on her way, seeming to feel
and rejoice in the responsibility which was imposed
upon her. Certainly she was doing all that was expected
of her. We were approaching the <em>Ruoara</em>; for
that was the name of the old boat, though it was a
misnomer now to her, for she did not deign to visit
the town after which she was called. She was making
her best time, which, however, was very poor time,
compared with the new boat. Her captain was evidently
hurrying her all he could. I made the signal
with the steam-whistle, to indicate that the <em>Ucayga</em> intended
to pass her on the port hand.</p>

<p>I was not a little startled to see her put her helm to
starboard, and crowd over upon our track, as though
she intended to bother us. I took the wheel with Van
Wolter, and when she had forced herself in ahead of
us, I sounded the whistle to go on the starboard hand
of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>“Give her a wide berth,” said I to my companion.</p>

<p>“I reckon we can hit as hard as she can,” chuckled
the mate.</p>

<p>“But we won’t hit at all, either hard or soft,” I
added.</p>

<p>“She has put her helm to port, as though she did
not mean to let us pass her.”</p>

<p>“She can’t help herself,” I answered, as I crowded
the helm over, so as to give her a wide berth.</p>

<p>By this time we were abreast of her, and the old tub
was so clumsy that she found it impossible to crowd us
any further. She had come up so that we could recognize
faces on board of her. Near the wheel-house
stood the major and Tommy, looking as ugly as they
conveniently could look. They would have sunk us in
the deep waters of the lake if they could. I was not
disposed to irritate them; for I knew how miserably
they felt, as they gazed upon our crowded decks, and
as they saw our palatial craft sweeping swiftly by
them. It did not appear that the <em>Ruoara</em> had more
than forty or fifty passengers.</p>

<p>“We can afford to be polite,” said I to Waddie.<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
“We will give them the compliments of the day as
we pass.”</p>

<p>“Don’t vex them,” replied Waddie.</p>

<p>“If they wish to take a common civility as an insult,
they may. On deck, there!” I cried to the hands forward.
“Stand by, and dip the ensign and the jack!”</p>

<p>Two of the crew promptly obeyed my order. The
ensign at the stern, and the jack at the bow, were
dipped three times, just as we came abreast of the
<em>Ruoara</em>. Our passengers were disposed to be exceedingly
good-natured, and before I was aware of their
purpose, they were engaged in giving three cheers,
and in demonstrating with hats, handkerchiefs, and
other articles. Not a sign of acknowledgment was
made by the old boat, and I am afraid that the magnate
of Middleport did not feel as happy as the people in our
boat. We passed her, and soon left her far behind.</p>

<p>We made our landings at the other ports of the
lake, creating no little excitement by our unexpected
appearance. We took all the passengers and freight
that were waiting for a passage, leaving nothing for
the old boat, for the first-comer always carried off the
prize. Promptly on the time I had marked down on<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
my program, the <em>Ucayga</em> entered the narrow river on
which Hitaca is located. We whistled with tremendous
vigor to inform the people of the place of our
arrival, for I was very anxious that Colonel Wimpleton
should be apprised of our approach.</p>

<p>Van Wolter was perfectly at home in the navigation
of this river, and piloted the boat, without any delay,
to the broad lagoon which forms the harbor of the
town. It was just half-past seven when the bow line
was thrown on shore, and in a few moments more the
steamer was fast to the wharf. Our approach had been
heralded through the town, and the landing-place was
crowded with vehicles, which had come down to convey
our passengers to the hotels, or to their homes.
With them had come a goodly delegation of the solid
men of Hitaca, as well as the miscellaneous rabble
which always waits upon the advent of any new sensation.</p>

<p>Almost the first person I recognized on the wharf,
from my position on the hurricane-deck, was Colonel
Wimpleton. The <em>Ucayga</em> had been discovered and
identified when miles down the lake, and her owner
would have learned of her coming, even if he had not<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
been engaged with the steamboat-builder on the creek
near the wharf. I looked at him with interest, for
though we had achieved a triumphant success, we had
acted without his sanction, and even without his
knowledge.</p>

<p>The moment the boat touched the wharf, the colonel
rushed on board and hastened up to the place where
he had seen Waddie and me. He looked as though he
was laboring under some excitement, but I had yet to
learn whether he was angry or not. Certainly he did
not look very gentle; but then his astonishment at
seeing the <em>Ucayga</em> at Hitaca was a sufficient explanation
of his troubled aspect.</p>

<p>“What does all this mean, Wolf?” he demanded,
rather sharply; but this was his habit.</p>

<p>“If any one is to blame, I am the one, for I told
Wolf to run the boat to this place to-day,” interposed
Waddie.</p>

<p>“But what are you here for?”</p>

<p>“We were compelled to come, sir,” I replied. “The
action of the railroad line left us no other course. If
you will walk into my room, sir, I will explain the<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
whole matter; and I hope it will prove satisfactory
to you.”</p>

<p>“But this is a very strange movement on your part;
and without a word from me,” said Colonel Wimpleton,
as I led the way into my stateroom. “You have
broken up your trips to Centreport, and there will be a
howl of indignation there when I return.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, sir. We shall run every trip from
Centreport to Ucayga, as usual.”</p>

<p>“Well, explain yourself,” continued the magnate
impatiently. “Does the boat need repairs, that you
have brought her up here?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; she is in good order in every respect.
This morning, Major Toppleton made his next move,
and we have not had a single through passenger on
the down trips to-day. As I supposed he would do,
he ordered his boat not to go to Centreport until after
our steamer had started. He took his yacht and went
over to Gulfport early this morning, so that the first
boat did not touch on our side of the lake till the
<em>Ucayga</em> had sailed.”</p>

<p>“That’s one of his tricks.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I don’t know that I blame him. He<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
means business, and he meant to keep all the through
passengers. At Ucayga, to-day, he and Tommy
crowed over me, and defied me to do anything I
pleased. Now, sir, if you look at my time-table, you
will see that we can, by hard work, make two trips a
day from Centreport, and one from Hitaca, to and
from the foot of the lake.”</p>

<p>The great man put on his spectacles, and proceeded
to examine the program which I had placed in his
hands. With the explanations I made, he comprehended
the whole subject. His countenance lighted up
with pleasure as he realized that he had the means in
his hands, even now, to win the day in the battle with
his great enemy.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you mention this thing before, Wolf?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of it, sir. When Major Toppleton
made his next move, as he called it, I went to work on
the problem, to see what could be done. I didn’t like
the idea of running from Centreport with only half a
freight. I want to make the boat pay.”</p>

<p>“She will pay handsomely under this arrangement.
Do you think we need another boat, now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I do. This boat will be going from half-past
six in the morning till half-past seven at night;
and the hands will be on duty from five in the morning
till nine at night. The boats will all need repairs, and
there will be no time to make them.”</p>

<p>“You can have two sets of hands, if you like.”</p>

<p>“But we can make only one trip a day from Hitaca
to Ucayga.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is really enough, for the railroad line
has very few passengers up in the morning, or down
in the afternoon. We shall take the lion’s share of
them. This boat-builder has raised his price so much
that I have not yet made a contract with him.”</p>

<p>“We can try our plan for a while, if you approve
it, sir,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Certainly I approve it.”</p>

<p>Waddie produced the handbills he had procured at
Centreport, and a person was employed to distribute
them all over Hitaca. Colonel Wimpleton inserted
advertisements in the papers, paying liberally for “editorial
puffs” of the new line. Everything promised an
entire success for the enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>At quarter-past eight, the old <em>Ruoara</em> made her
appearance, and moored at the wharf just above the
<em>Ucayga</em>. It was a meager show of passengers which
landed from her, and I could well understand the rage
which filled the bosom of the major and his son, as
they stood upon the hurricane-deck gazing at the new
steamer. I wondered what their next move would be,
for it was not in the nature of either of them to submit
to the mortifying defeat they had sustained. I could
think of nothing that it was possible for them to do to
retrieve their misfortune, unless the major built new
steamers, or continued the Lake Shore Railroad to
Hitaca.</p>

<p>As they did not come near me, I did not devote
much attention to a consideration of their case. Having
nothing more to do on board, I took a walk on
shore with Waddie. I visited a clothing-store, and
purchased a suit of blue clothes, which included a
frock coat. When I got up the next morning, I put on
the new garments, and surveyed myself in the glass.
The effect was decidedly satisfactory. I had a glazed
cap, for I was not quite ready to don a high hat. As<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
I surveyed myself, I had hopes that I should not again
be accused of being a boy.</p>

<p>At quarter of six the <em>Ruoara</em> left the wharf. I
could not see more than a dozen passengers on board.
I looked in vain for Tommy and his father. Soon
after, the people began to pour in upon the decks of the
<em>Ucayga</em>, to the great satisfaction of Colonel Wimpleton.
Our handbills had accomplished their purpose,
and our triumph was to be even greater than that of
the day before. I was very much excited by the lively
scene around me. Carriages and other vehicles were
constantly arriving with freight and passengers, and I
found enough to do in answering questions and hurrying
up the men engaged in loading freight. Five minutes
before the hour of starting, the scene became a
little more quiet. I stood upon the wharf, looking at
the situation, when I saw Major Toppleton and his
son, accompanied by a stranger, approaching me.</p>

<p>“There he is!” said Tommy, pointing to me with
his finger. “Grab him!”</p>

<p>Hearing the words, I deemed it prudent to hasten
on board, for I concluded that this was the sequel to
the affair of the day before in Middleport. I hurried<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
to the plank; but before I could reach the deck, the
stranger seized me by the collar. I struggled to
escape, but the man was too strong for me.</p>

<p>“I have a warrant for your arrest,” said he.</p>

<p>A trick of the enemy!</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE STEAMBOAT EXCURSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hold on to him!” shouted Tommy. “This is our
next move.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to trouble you, Captain Penniman; but
I must do my duty,” said the constable.</p>

<p>“I should like to inquire what all this means,” I
added, as the officer, finding I did not attempt to annihilate
him, let go his hold of me.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; the warrant comes up from Middleport.
I suppose it is all right.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop here with him,” interposed Major Toppleton.
“Take him away to jail, or some other safe
place.”</p>

<p>By this time Colonel Wimpleton was at my side
with Waddie, both of them so indignant that I was
afraid that a scene would transpire on the spot. My
powerful patron desired to see the warrant, and the
constable, to the great disgust of the major, exhibited
the document.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Colonel Wimpleton. “This warrant
commands you to bring your prisoner before a
magistrate at Middleport. Step right on board of our
boat, and we will see that you are enabled to obey the
command to the letter.”</p>

<p>“I am satisfied,” answered the constable.</p>

<p>“But I am not,” interposed Major Toppleton
angrily.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” shouted Van Wolter.</p>

<p>“I shall do my duty as I understand it,” continued
the constable, as I led the way to the deck of the
<em>Ucayga</em>.</p>

<p>“It is your duty to commit him to jail,” growled the
magnate of Middleport.</p>

<p>“I will be responsible for the consequences,” added
Colonel Wimpleton, who could afford to be good-natured,
as he saw his great rival defeated in his purpose.</p>

<p>To my surprise, both Major Toppleton and his son
followed us on board, and did not offer to go on shore
when the plank was hauled in, and the fasts cast off.
They had evidently remained at Hitaca for the purpose
of carrying out the little scheme they had contrived;<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
and, having done their worst, they had no
further business there. Probably they could not endure
the idea of remaining at the upper end of the
lake while the battle between the two lines was going
on at the other end. They had learned from our handbills,
so profusely scattered through the town, that the
<em>Ucayga</em> would make another through trip in the afternoon,
and it was necessary for them to be at Ucayga to
attend to the interests of the Lake Shore Railroad.</p>

<p>It was plain to me that Major Toppleton had come
up to Hitaca with the warrant in his pocket, not to
obtain justice for the injury which Tommy had sustained,
but to interfere with the operations of the new
line. I should have been arrested the day before if
Grace Toppleton, whom I had come to regard as an
angel of peace in my path, had not given me warning.
My enemies must have been entirely satisfied that they
could not hold me responsible for the damage done to
Tommy, and my arrest was only intended as a blow
at the steamboat line. At Hitaca, doubtless, they expected
to detain my boat long enough, at least, to make
her lose her connection at the lower end of the lake.</p>

<p>The arrival of the <em>Ucayga</em> at Hitaca, and the announcement<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
of a new daily line, at reduced rates, had
created no little excitement in the town. The people
believed that they were to be better accommodated, and,
very naturally, their sympathies were with the new
line, as the large number of passengers we carried
fully proved. The constable told me that he had been
called upon to serve the warrant only a few minutes
before he made his appearance on the wharf. He saw
at once that it was a trick to annoy the new line, but
he could not help himself. The moment Colonel
Wimpleton showed him how he could discharge his
duty without injury to the enterprise, he promptly
embraced the opportunity. Major Toppleton and
Tommy were doubtless sorely vexed at their failure;
but they went into the cabin, and I did not see them
again for some time.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful autumnal morning when the
<em>Ucayga</em> started upon her trip, crowded with passengers.
Colonel Wimpleton, alive to the importance of
this day’s work, had engaged the Hitaca Cornet Band
to enliven the passage with their music. The weather
was warm, and the soft haze of the Indian summer
hung over the hills on the shore, where the woods<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
presented the many hues of the changing foliage. The
water was as tranquil as a dream of peace, and the inspiring
strains of the band completed the pleasure of
the occasion.</p>

<p>I explained to Colonel Wimpleton, Waddie, and
others who were interested in the matter, the occasion
of the proceedings against me. It is needless to say
that I had no lack of friends; and, with the consent
of the constable, it was arranged that he should take
me before the magistrate at noon, while the boat was
at Centreport. No charge could be proved against
me, and I hardly gave the subject a thought.</p>

<p>The passage down the lake was a delightful one.
We passed the old <em>Ruoara</em> just before we made the
landing at Gulfport. At this town we saw Major
Toppleton and his son go ashore, for the purpose of
taking the railroad boat on her arrival. Neither of
them showed himself on the trip, and I only hoped
they appreciated the new steamer, and enjoyed the delightful
music. I was rather afraid the colonel would
court a collision with his powerful rival; but I am
happy to say he was too good-natured, in the flush of
his success, to exult over his enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[257]</span></p>

<p>We made all our landings, and, passing through the
Horse-Shoe Channel as usual, arrived at Ucayga on
time. This concluded our first round-trip to the head
of the lake. It was a success far beyond our most
sanguine hopes, and the exchequer of the steamboat
company was largely benefited by it. The future was
as bright as the present, and really I could not see that
the Lake Shore Road had any chance against us.</p>

<p>But this was to be a day of excitement. Colonel
Wimpleton landed at Centreport for the purpose of
organizing a grand steamboat excursion to Ucayga
and back in the afternoon; and when the boat returned
I found the town in a blaze, for a pleasure trip, with a
band of music, was no small affair to the people.
Handbills were scattered throughout the place, and,
as we had the advantage of a magnificent day, there
was no want of enthusiasm on the subject.</p>

<p>As soon as the steamer reached Centreport, I went
with the constable, Colonel Wimpleton, and the ablest
lawyer in the place, over to Middleport. We found
Captain Portman at the hotel, and hastened to the
office of the magistrate. Like my friend from up the
lake, I waived the examination, and was simply bound<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
over to appear before the court several weeks hence
for trial. Colonel Wimpleton and one of his friends
gave bonds for my appearance, and the excitement in
this direction was ended.</p>

<p>I went home, and invited my mother and sisters to
the excursion in the afternoon. Of course I had a
long story to tell of the history of the trip to Hitaca,
and I had attentive listeners in the dear ones at home.
I knew that my mother dreaded and deprecated the
fearful rivalry which was going on between the two
sides. I assured her that the best way to make peace
was not always by giving up. One party was as
nearly right as the other, and when each had shown
his full strength there would be a better opportunity
to heal the breach. I told her that, so far as I was
concerned, and Waddie also, there was no ill-feeling.
It was a business competition, in which neither had
any reason to complain of the other, so long as he did
not trench upon his rights.</p>

<p>As I walked down to the lake with my mother and
sisters, I saw Grace Toppleton in her father’s garden.
I wished that I could invite her to the excursion, for
nothing could have added so much to its pleasure as<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
her presence. But it was not proper for me to ask
her, and it would not have been proper for her to accept
if I had. I was proud and happy as I went on
board of the <em>Ucayga</em> with my mother and sisters. The
steamer was already filled with passengers, and at half-past
two we started. The band struck up an appropriate
air as the wheels began to turn, and I never saw
a happier party than that which crowded the decks of
the <em>Ucayga</em>. In spite of the excitement, in spite of the
throng on board, we were, as usual, on time.</p>

<p>When we touched the wharf near the railroad, the
ferry-boat had arrived, and I saw Major Toppleton
and Tommy on shore, listening to the music and observing
the multitude which covered our decks. I
hoped I should not meet them, face to face, again; for
I knew that our success had only increased their bitterness
toward me. But they did not seem to be so
ugly as when I had last seen them. Indeed, there was
a smile upon their faces, as though the music delighted
them. When our bow line was thrown ashore, they
stepped on board, and came upon the hurricane-deck,
where I stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[260]</span></p>

<p>“You seem to be having a great time to-day, Wolf,”
said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Only a little excursion,” I replied. “But the music
is good, and I rather enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“So do I, Wolf,” answered Tommy graciously. “I
am going up with you, if you have no objection.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Here is my stateroom; and if you
and your father will walk in, I will do the best I can
to make you comfortable,” I replied, pointing to my
apartment.</p>

<p>“Thank you; I prefer to be on deck,” added
Tommy. “You have beaten us all to pieces to-day,
Wolf, and we give it up now. What’s the use of quarreling
about it?”</p>

<p>“None at all, most assuredly,” I replied, with enthusiasm.
“There is Waddie Wimpleton, who is just
of your opinion.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think much of Waddie, as you know,
Wolf. I only meant that you and I wouldn’t quarrel.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you and Waddie should quarrel.
He intends to do the right thing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he does; but the least said is soonest
mended,” said Tommy, rather coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>I was amazed and astounded at this sudden change
of front in Tommy, who had hardly bestowed a pleasant
word upon me for months. I could not feel sure
that he meant what he said; but I resolved to afford
him no cause of complaint if he really was sincere.
It seemed to me more probable that he had some end
to gain, under the mask of friendship, than that he
was willing to make peace with me.</p>

<p>“Your boat appears to be doing remarkably well to-day,
Wolf,” said Major Toppleton, stepping up to me.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; she is making good trips to-day.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Wolf, you need give yourself no uneasiness
about that trial. I caused your arrest under
a misapprehension, and no harm shall come to you.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear you say so, sir, though I
really had no fears of the consequences.”</p>

<p>“I am going to adopt Tommy’s suggestions, and
have no more quarreling,” added the great man.</p>

<p>“I hope not, sir.”</p>

<p>“You can have it all your own way on the lake
now.”</p>

<p>“I only wish to do what is right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>“I know you do, Wolf. Are you at home in the
evening, now?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I have to spend the night at Hitaca. I
suppose our family will move up there soon, and you
will get rid of us then.”</p>

<p>“We don’t desire to get rid of you,” interposed
Tommy.</p>

<p>“I want to see you, Wolf, when you are at leisure,”
continued the major. “When can you call upon me?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow noon, if you please,” I replied, delighted
at the prospect of again being permitted to
stand under the same roof with Grace.</p>

<p>“I will be at home,” said the magnate, as he walked
away at the approach of Colonel Wimpleton.</p>

<p>“What does Toppleton want with you?” asked Colonel
Wimpleton, coming up to me after the major and
his son had retired.</p>

<p>The magnate of Centreport looked ugly, as though,
in the moment of his great triumph, he feared a conspiracy
to rob the steamboat company of the laurels
it had won.</p>

<p>“Nothing in particular, that I am aware of,” I replied,
not exactly pleased to have even an unkind look
bestowed upon me, after the victory which I had been
instrumental in winning.</p>

<p>“You seem to be on excellent terms with him,”
sneered the colonel.</p>

<p>“I do not wish to quarrel with any one.”</p>

<p>“What did Toppleton want?” demanded the great
man, rather more sharply than the occasion seemed to
require.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he wants anything. He invited<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
me to call at his house, and I promised to do so,” I
answered candidly.</p>

<p>“You did!”</p>

<p>“I did, sir. Both the major and Tommy were kind
enough to say that they did not wish to quarrel with
me; and certainly I have no ill-will against them.”</p>

<p>“You have not!” repeated Colonel Wimpleton, with
emphasis. “Am I not your bail on a groundless charge
preferred by them?”</p>

<p>“But they have done me more of good than of evil;
and the major said no harm should come to me on
account of the trial.”</p>

<p>“Wolf, I don’t like this way of doing things. If you
are in my service, I don’t want you to have anything
to do with my enemies. If three dollars a day is not
enough for a boy like you, I will give you four or five;
but you mustn’t play into the hands of Toppleton.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to do so, sir. I never yet deserted
those who used me well, and I don’t intend to begin
now. If you think you cannot trust me, sir, don’t
do it.”</p>

<p>The time for starting having arrived, the conversation,<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
which did not promise very agreeable results, was
interrupted. The band struck up its music, and the
<em>Ucayga</em> left the wharf. I went into my stateroom for
the purpose of being alone a moment, for I wanted to
think over what the colonel had just said to me. He
was evidently jealous of anything like intimacy between
the Toppletons and myself, and was afraid I
would “sell out” the steamboat company. I was not
flattered by the suspicion. I considered the subject
very faithfully; but I decided that it was unreasonable
in my present patron to insist that I should have nothing
to do with the Toppletons. As long as Grace lived
and smiled upon me, I could assent to nothing of the
kind, even if I lost my situation. At the same time,
I intended to be true to my employers, even if Grace
ceased to smile upon me for doing so.</p>

<p>On the up trip the <em>Ucayga</em> was even uncomfortably
crowded; for, besides the excursion party, we had a
large number of through passengers. But, as soon as
the boat was clear of the wharf, they began to settle
down, and to cease to crowd each other. The band
played splendidly, and everybody seemed to be satisfied.<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
At Centreport we left the crowd, though the
boat was still well filled. The program of the preceding
day was repeated. We passed the old <em>Ruoara</em> near
Gulfport, and arrived at Hitaca a little before the time
in my table. As we had kept all our promises, the new
line was in high favor with the public.</p>

<p>The next morning, the old boat departed with
hardly a corporal’s guard of passengers, while the
<em>Ucayga</em> was crowded. We landed our freight at
Ucayga on time, and everybody was satisfied that the
new line was an assured success. I need not follow its
triumphs any further, for it would be only a repetition
of what has already been said. The steamboat line
was carrying nearly all the passengers. The old-line
boats had hardly business enough to pay for the oil
used on the machinery, though the Lake Shore Railroad
did tolerably well with its local trade.</p>

<p>When the <em>Ucayga</em> arrived at Centreport, on the day
after the excursion, I crossed the lake; and, after a
short visit to my mother, I hastened to the mansion of
Major Toppleton. I was not only curious to know
what the major wanted of me, but I was thirsting for
the opportunity to meet Grace. The latter motive was<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
doubtless the stronger one; for, since the poor girl had
risked so much to give me warning of the intended
arrest, I flattered myself that she was not wholly indifferent
to me.</p>

<p>With a fluttering heart I rang the bell at the door
of Major Toppleton’s house. I was admitted to the
library. Neither the great man nor his son was at
home; but the servant assured me they would soon
return, for it wanted but a few minutes of lunch-time.
I ventured to ask if Miss Grace was at home. I knew
she was, for I heard the piano in one of the neighboring
rooms, and the music was so sweet I was sure no
hands but hers could produce it. In a moment she
entered the library, her soft cheeks crimsoned with a
blush, which made me feel exceedingly awkward.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Wolf! I am so glad to see you!” said
she; and, in the enthusiasm of the moment, she advanced
toward me, and gave me her hand.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you cannot be as glad to see me as I am
to see you,” I replied, pressing the little hand in mine.</p>

<p>Dear me! What was I doing? Straightway I
began to feel very queer and awkward, and cheap and<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
mean. She was confused, and apparently astonished
by the boldness of my remark, for she retired to a
sofa on the other side of the room. I was beginning
to thank her for the great service she had rendered me
on Monday, when Major Toppleton and Tommy,
whom the stupid servant had taken the trouble to summon,
entered the library. I wished they had deferred
their coming for half an hour. Both of them seemed
to be very glad to see me, and took no notice of the
presence of Grace. To my astonishment, the magnate
invited me to lunch with him. I had not the courage
to refuse, or, in other words, to banish myself from the
presence of Grace.</p>

<p>“Wolf, we had just nine passengers from Hitaca this
morning,” said the major, with a chuckling laugh, as
though he intended to make the best of his discomfiture.</p>

<p>“We had over two hundred and fifty,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon we had a fair freight down;
but we can’t do anything against that new steamer,
especially when you have a band of music on board,”
added the major. “Will you take some of this cold
chicken?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[269]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you, sir&mdash;a little. For your sake I am
sorry the steamboat line is doing so well.”</p>

<p>“You can do anything you please with Colonel Wimpleton,
just now,” he added.</p>

<p>“I think not, sir.”</p>

<p>“I believe you can. The fact is, you suggested the
plan by which the railroad line has been defeated.”</p>

<p>“But the plan is already in working order, and it
will go on just as well without me as with me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry we had any trouble with you, Wolf,
for suddenly from a boy you have become a man, and
a dangerous man, too, for our side of the lake.”</p>

<p>I was forced to believe that this was mere flattery,
intended to help along some object not yet mentioned.</p>

<p>“I have done the best I could for my employers, on
whichever side I happened to be engaged.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. I am going to speak plainly now,
Wolf. We are beaten; but we don’t intend to remain
beaten for any great length of time. The prosperity
of Middleport depends greatly upon the Lake
Shore Railroad, and I intend to make that a success if
it costs me all I am worth. I shall build a bridge at<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
the foot of the lake, so that I can go into Ucayga without
the aid of a ferry-boat. A Lightning Express is
going through from Middleport to the station at
Ucayga in three-quarters of an hour. So far I am determined.”</p>

<p>“That will not help your case much, so far as
through travel is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Considerable, Wolf. We shall save fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“But we shall still beat you by half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Very true; but I don’t intend to stop here. I shall
either build a steamer equal or superior to the <em>Ucayga</em>,
to run between Hitaca and Middleport, or I shall run
the railroad to the head of the lake.”</p>

<p>“Will it pay?”</p>

<p>“I think it will, but, though Wimpleton and I have
always quarreled of late years, I am willing to be fair.
I have a plan, which I will state to you. If Wimpleton
will run the <em>Ucayga</em> from Hitaca to Middleport in
connection with the railroad, I will take off my boats.
This will be a fair thing for both of us. You may
state the case to him. If he agrees to it, all right; if
not, I shall make my next move.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[271]</span></p>

<p>This, then, was what the major was driving at, and
I was to be the ambassador between the rivals. I was
willing to do the best I could, but I proposed that
Tommy and Waddie should meet and discuss the matter.
The little magnate of Middleport promptly and
indignantly refused to meet the other little magnate.
I promised to report the next day on my mission. As
I was leaving, I invited Mrs. Toppleton and Grace to
make a trip with me up or down the lake. Somewhat
to my surprise, at the suggestion of the major, they
accepted the invitation for that day. We crossed the
lake, and I assure the reader I took every pains to
make my guests happy.</p>

<p>Neither Waddie nor his father was on board again
that day; but the latter went up to Hitaca with me
in the afternoon. Cautiously approaching the subject
I stated Major Toppleton’s proposition. The colonel
would hardly listen to it, much less accept it. He
swore, and abused his great rival. He would have
nothing to do with Toppleton. He would sink the
<em>Ucayga</em> before he would help the railroad to a single
passenger. He was very savage, and, before he had<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
finished, poured out the vials of his wrath upon me for
mentioning the subject.</p>

<p>The next day I reported the result of my mission;
and Major Toppleton was quite as savage as the colonel
had been. He swore, too, and declared that he
would run the <em>Ucayga</em> off the route before another
summer.</p>

<p>I spoke to Waddie on the subject, and he expressed
a strong desire to meet Tommy, and to be friends with
him. He favored the plan of Major Toppleton, and
if he had possessed as much influence over his father
as Tommy over his, the arrangement would doubtless
have been made. I was not without hope that the
plan might yet be adopted.</p>

<p>But I have told my story as a steamboat captain;
and anything more would be but a repetition. I had
labored to make peace, but had failed. If there were
olive branches in the future, there were none in the
present. I continued to run the <em>Ucayga</em> during the
winter, with the same success which attended her from
the first of my connection with her. We did about
all the through business, and the Lake Shore Railroad
languished under the competition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[273]</span></p>

<p>At the next meeting of the steamboat company
Waddie resigned, to the intense indignation of his
father, and Dick Bayard was elected president. He
also declined a reelection as major of the battalion,
and Ben Pinkerton was chosen to the command. Thus
far Waddie was true to his good resolutions, though
he had much difficulty with his father on account of
the change. He often came to me for advice, for the
students of the institute seemed to distrust him still.
No mutiny or rebellion occurred on his side of the
lake, for the resigning of his offices prevented any
collision.</p>

<p>Tom Walton made a good thing out of the <em>Belle</em>,
and when the season closed, I obtained a place for him
as deck-hand on board of the <em>Ucayga</em>, where he did
tolerably well for the winter.</p>

<p>In November our family moved up to Hitaca, for
my father and I were compelled to spend our nights
and Sundays at that port. Our place in Middleport
was let for the winter. Occasionally, while lying at
Centreport, I made an errand over to Major Toppleton’s
that I might see Grace; but I seldom met her. I<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
hoped, most earnestly, that the two lines might be
united, and peace restored between the two great
houses. As Waddie was in favor of it, the prospect
was not altogether dark. As the union meant peace,
I continued to labor for it. If effected, the <em>Ucayga</em>
would lie at the wharf in Middleport between trips.
I earnestly desired it. Then Grace would be a frequent
passenger on the boat.</p>

<p>I have told the story of “The Young Captain of the
<em>Ucayga</em> Steamer;” how he became captain, and how
well he succeeded in this capacity. The story is complete,
and nothing more remains to be said of him; but
the history of the great quarrel between the two sides
of the lake, which has other phases, is not finished.
There is another story to be told; but, as most of its
events transpired while I was absent, I could only tell
it from hearsay. I prefer that it should be related
by an actual witness, and for this reason I have invited
my friend Ned Skotchley to take the pen, and
write “Switch Off; or, The War of the Students.”</p>

<p>I told Ned not to say anything more about me than
he was obliged to do; but he is an obstinate fellow,
and I find, by looking over his manuscript, that he has,<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
to a very great extent, disregarded my instructions.
But I am not responsible for the praise he bestows
upon me, though, whatever he says of me, I am conscious
that I have tried to be a Christian, to be faithful
to my employers, and always to be “On Time.”</p>

<p class="center p1">THE END</p>

<p class="p1">“Switch Off” is the title of the next volume in the
<span class="smcap">Alger Series</span>, No. 150, by Oliver Optic, in which
there are many rare adventures and an ending which
is eminently satisfactory.</p>

<p>Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be&mdash;behind bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p></div>

<p>There is no more romantic character in American history than William
F. Cody, or, as he was internationally known, Buffalo Bill. He,
with Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, Wild Bill Hickok, General Custer,
and a few other adventurous spirits, laid the foundation of our great
West.</p>

<p>There is no more brilliant page in American history than the winning
of the West. Never did pioneers live more thrilling lives, so
rife with adventure and brave deeds, as the old scouts and plainsmen.
Foremost among these stands the imposing figure of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>All of the books in this list are intensely interesting. They were
written by the close friend and companion of Buffalo Bill&mdash;Colonel
Prentiss Ingraham. They depict actual adventures which this pair of
hard-hitting comrades experienced, while the story of these adventures
is interwoven with fiction; historically the books are correct.</p></div>

<p>For the present the Adventure Library will be devoted to the
publication of stories by William Wallace Cook.</p>

<p>The fact that one man wrote all of these stories in no way
detracts from their interest, as they are all very different in plot
and locality.</p>

<p>For example, the action in one story takes place in “The Land
of Little Rain;” another deals with adventure on the high seas;
another is a good railroad story; others are splendid Western
stories; and some are mystery stories. All of them, however,
are stories of vigorous adventure drawn true to life, which gives
them the thrill that all really good fiction should have.</p></div>

<p class="center"><em>ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT</em></p>

<p>In order that there may be no confusion, we desire to say that
the books listed below will be issued during the respective months
in New York City and vicinity. They may not reach the readers
at a distance promptly, on account of delays in transportation.</p>

<p class="nobreak center xxlargefont boldfont">Not How Much<br />
<em>But</em><br />
HOW GOOD</p>

<p>In the editorial preparation of the STREET
&amp; SMITH NOVEL the question of how much
in money we were going to get for each volume
never really occurred to us. We lost sight entirely
of the fact that these books sold at 15
cents the copy, and gave as much serious consideration
to the selection and preparation of
the stories as though they were going to sell for
ten times as much.</p>

<p>We think, after all, that this is the real test
of service. That we are performing a service
to millions of American readers, there can be
no doubt. Never before has such reading matter
been placed within the reach of the modest
purse. We have striven to keep our line clean
and feel confident that we have done so.</p>

<p>The very nature of the stories published in
the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS insures them
consideration from people who have no time nor
inclination to read the classics, and who probably
would not read anything else if they did
not have the STREET &amp; SMITH books.</p>

<p>Any decent literature that instills a desire on
the part of the general public to read is, in our
opinion, performing a real service.</p>

<p class="nobreak xxlargefont boldfont center">The Dealer</p>

<p>who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVELS are superior to all others.</p>

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
that nothing except clean, wholesome
literature finds its way into our lines.</p>

<p>Therefore, the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer is a careful and wise tradesman, and it
is fair to assume selects the other articles he
has for sale with the same degree of intelligence
as he does his paper-covered books.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
